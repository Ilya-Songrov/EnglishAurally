-800 ms - смещение фрагмента; 1050 - смещение верхней границы фрагмента. (Нужно доработать)

00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:42,438
When I was lying there
in the VA hospital,

2
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:45,444
with a big hole blown
through the middle of my life,

3
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,741
I started having these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:51,575
I was free.

5
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:58,418
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

6
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:16,723
In cryo, you don't dream at all.

7
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,768
It doesn't feel like 6 years.

8
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:22,274
More like a 5th of tequila
and an ass-kicking.

9
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:30,655
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

10
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:33,953
He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space

11
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,328
to find the answers.

12
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:37,828
Are we there yet?

13
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:39,705
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

14
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:41,833
We're there.

15
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:43,377
It's about your brother.

16
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:49,849
So, a week before
Tommy's gonna ship out,

17
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:53,639
a guy with a gun ends his journey
for the paper in his wallet.

18
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:58,805
You've been in cryo for 5 years,
9 months and 22 days.

19
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:01,812
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

20
00:02:01,944 --> 00:02:04,482
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks...

21
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:06,571
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.

22
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:09,866
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going someplace he's gonna regret.

23
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,755
Up ahead was Pandora.

24
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:31,134
You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.

25
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:44,567
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

26
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:47,482
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

27
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:52,111
And since your genome is identical
to his, you could step into his shoes,

28
00:02:53,662 --> 00:02:55,038
so to speak.

29
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,994
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

30
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:13,341
And the pay is good.

31
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:15,934
Very good.

32
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:41,242
-Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
-Exo-packs on! Let's go!

33
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,657
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

34
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:46,413
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in 4 minutes!

35
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:49,834
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

36
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,304
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

37
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:56,175
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

38
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:35,721
One life ends,

39
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,926
another begins.

40
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,687
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

41
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:51,234
-Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
-Harnesses off! One minute!

42
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:55,313
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

43
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,988
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

44
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:08,327
Go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go!

45
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:15,211
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

46
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:19,264
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude.

47
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:23,382
I told myself I could pass
any test a man could pass.

48
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:31,229
They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,

49
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,031
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.

50
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:38,861
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

51
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:40,654
Well, well, ladies.

52
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,949
Look at all this fresh meat!

53
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:53,876
Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

54
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:55,468
fighting for freedom.

55
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,720
Look out, hot rod!

56
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:07,054
But out here they're just hired guns,

57
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:09,976
taking the money,
working for the company.

58
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,437
Check this out, man.

59
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,569
Meals on wheels.

60
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:17,775
Man, that is just wrong.

61
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:19,690
I got 2 guys free in about 20 minutes!

62
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,320
Got it! Need them!

63
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:32,877
You're not in Kansas anymore.

64
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:39,209
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

65
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:43,046
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

66
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:46,929
If there is a hell,

67
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:52,308
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

68
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:55,316
Out there, beyond that fence,

69
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:59,739
every living thing
that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

70
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:02,986
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

71
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:09,658
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

72
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:12,081
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

73
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:14,963
that'll stop your heart in 1 minute.

74
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,384
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

75
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:21,844
They are very hard to kill.

76
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:27,298
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

77
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,014
I will not succeed.

78
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,608
Not with all of you.

79
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:37,728
If you wish to survive,

80
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:40,697
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

81
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,691
You've got to obey the rules.

82
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:46,493
Pandora rules.

83
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:49,449
Rule number 1...

84
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,207
There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief

85
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:52,994
to put your mind at ease.

86
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,820
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!

87
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:01,301
You're Jake, right?
Tom's brother.

88
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:03,801
You look just like him.

89
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,631
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

90
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,724
into the bio-lab.

91
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,974
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

92
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,306
-Hi.
-Hey.

93
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:17,985
Link... Here's the link room right here.

94
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:20,353
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

95
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:24,238
Me and Norm are here to drive

96
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:27,487
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars.

97
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,578
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

98
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,618
-Hey. Welcome.
-Hey.

99
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:37,078
-Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
-Thanks.

100
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:40,959
Damn! They got big.

101
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:43,583
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

102
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,008
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

103
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,966
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

104
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:49,926
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

105
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,933
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

106
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:53,807
There's yours.

107
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:57,101
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

108
00:08:57,233 --> 00:09:00,068
-Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
-Good to meet you, yeah.

109
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,469
Looks like him.

110
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:28,554
No, it looks like you.

111
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,591
This is your avatar now, Jake.

112
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:39,225
And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,

113
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,103
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

114
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:44,940
or something.

115
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:50,701
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

116
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:53,614
which is insanely expensive.

117
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:57,831
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

118
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,083
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

119
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,205
You know, what we see, what we feel.

120
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,009
-It's all part of the science.
-And good science is good observation.

121
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:07,506
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next 6 years.

122
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:10,388
All right. Whatever.

123
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,016
So...

124
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,513
Well, here I am,

125
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:19,689
doing science.

126
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,442
They're coming out!

127
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:25,024
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

128
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,703
God.

129
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:37,331
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

130
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,629
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys!

131
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:44,267
What's wrong with this picture?

132
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:48,293
-Thank you!
-Grace Augustine is a legend.

133
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:50,883
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

134
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:53,718
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

135
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:56,056
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

136
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,435
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

137
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:02,222
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

138
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:07,691
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

139
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,939
May the All Mother...

140
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,109
smile upon our first meeting.

141
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:16,405
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

142
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:19,788
I studied for 5 years...

143
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,951
but there is much to learn.

144
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:25,662
-Grace? This is Jake Sully.
-Ma'am.

145
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:30,254
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

146
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:33,969
You know, the PhD who trained
for 3 years for this mission?

147
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,473
He's dead.

148
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,514
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

149
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,931
-How much lab training have you had?
-I dissected a frog once.

150
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:47,525
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

151
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:49,942
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

152
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:51,270
-I'm going to Selfridge.
-No, Grace,

153
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:53,945
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-No, man, this is such bullshit!

154
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:55,451
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

155
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:58,413
He has no business
sticking his nose in my department.

156
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:03,247
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

157
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:15,461
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

158
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:18,385
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

159
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:25,513
-You see that?
-Yes, sir.

160
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,689
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

161
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:30,689
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

162
00:12:33,574 --> 00:12:37,785
Parker, you know,
I used to think it was benign neglect,

163
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:40,829
but now I see
that you're intentionally screwing me.

164
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:44,455
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

165
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:52,291
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

166
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:54,050
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

167
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:55,636
-Lucky?
-Yeah.

168
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,720
How is this in any way lucky?

169
00:12:57,848 --> 00:12:59,556
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

170
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:02,554
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

171
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:04,561
A Marine we can use.

172
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:06,515
I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

173
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:10,064
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

174
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:12,020
Look, look, you're supposed
to be winning the hearts

175
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,150
and the minds of the natives.

176
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,071
Isn't that the whole point of
your little puppet show?

177
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,657
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

178
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:18,408
then they'll start trusting us.

179
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:20,492
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

180
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,578
but after, what, how many years?

181
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,200
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

182
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,536
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

183
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:29,745
Right. Come here.

184
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,583
I can't... I can't...

185
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:38,762
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

186
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,925
Because this little gray rock sells
for 20 million a kilo.

187
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:45,262
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

188
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:47,222
It's what pays for your science.

189
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:51,733
Now, those savages
are threatening our whole operation,

190
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,058
we're on the brink of war,

191
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:56,362
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

192
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,941
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

193
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,370
So, how much link time have you logged?

194
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:17,089
-About 520 hours.
-That's good.

195
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:21,513
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

196
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,261
Zip. But I read a manual.

197
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:27,261
Tell me you're joking.

198
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:29,975
This is cool.

199
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:31,852
Let's go.

200
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:37,481
Don't. I got this.

201
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,448
So you just figured you'd come out here,

202
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,153
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

203
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,991
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

204
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:53,369
What was going through your head?

205
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:56,292
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

206
00:14:57,426 --> 00:14:59,667
-Biometrics are good.
-Link 3 is ready.

207
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,431
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

208
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,349
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

209
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:11,937
That shouldn't be hard for you.

210
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:13,856
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

211
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:15,354
Initiate link.

212
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:18,644
Run sequence unit 3. Go.

213
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,191
Launching.

214
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,079
I have the first congruency.

215
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:41,010
-That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
-Go figure.

216
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:43,045
Phase-lock 40%.

217
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,594
All right. Going in.

218
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:50,811
I'm going in in 4.

219
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:56,472
Phase-lock 99%. Link is stable.

220
00:16:11,374 --> 00:16:13,008
He's in.

221
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:17,210
Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

222
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,881
Pupillary reflex is good.

223
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:24,677
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

224
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,758
Hey, guys.

225
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,390
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

226
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:30,846
Good!

227
00:16:30,977 --> 00:16:32,436
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

228
00:16:32,562 --> 00:16:34,602
-And touch your thumb to your fingers.
-Yeah.

229
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,106
-Thumb to your fingers.
-No problem.

230
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:37,775
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

231
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,977
-Got it.
-Well, if you want to sit up,

232
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:41,356
-that's fine.
-Okay, good. Just take it

233
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:44,442
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

234
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:47,990
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?
You're wiggling your toes!

235
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,827
-Good. Good, Jake.
-That's great.

236
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:54,451
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

237
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:57,157
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

238
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,791
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

239
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:02,129
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

240
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:04,749
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

241
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:06,925
-so take it easy.
-Wait.

242
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:08,466
-Jake.
-Sit down, Jake.

243
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,970
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

244
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:13,303
-I need you to sit down. Jake!
-It's okay.

245
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:15,144
-Buddy, listen to me.
-It's all good. I got this.

246
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:18,889
-Jake, you need to sit down right now.
-Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

247
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,101
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

248
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:23,987
You need time to adjust to the avatar...
Jake!

249
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:26,320
-God, Jake, watch your tail.
-Yeah!

250
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,494
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand
milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

251
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,445
Guys! Guys!

252
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:33,993
By the numbers.

253
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:35,499
-Jake. Come on.
-Jake! Listen to me.

254
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,167
You're not used to your avatar body.

255
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:38,918
-This is dangerous.
-This is great.

256
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:42,248
-Jake? Jake, listen to me.
-Come on. They're gonna put you out.

257
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:47,512
-Norm, sit down.
-No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

258
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:49,179
God damn it! Bring them home!

259
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:51,879
-Norm! Do not leave control!
-You're not ready for it!

260
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:57,516
-Come on, you ain't got no skills.
-So close!

261
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,189
I don't even have to play defense on it.

262
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:00,726
Hey, guys. Hey.

263
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,100
-It's okay, I'll get him.
-Jake, you have to come back!

264
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:04,979
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

265
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:09,151
-Watch it!
-Sorry!

266
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:10,694
Come on!

267
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:14,663
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

268
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:26,582
-Jeez! Sorry.
-Watch it!

269
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:50,400
Hey, Marine!

270
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:52,612
Damn.

271
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:57,823
-Grace?
-Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

272
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,584
Think fast.

273
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,619
Motor control's looking good.

274
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:17,808
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

275
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,013
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

276
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:21,557
Hey, hey, hey!

277
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:24,312
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

278
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:25,852
That's kind of freaky.

279
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:28,392
Come on. Scat.

280
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:30,774
Good night.

281
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:35,617
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

282
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:00,681
Welcome back.

283
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,978
-You okay? You all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

284
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,947
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

285
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,204
Hold on a second.

286
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:23,618
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

287
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:28,213
-We bounce at 0-9.
-Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

288
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:30,880
Vine strike's still loose.

289
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:33,131
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

290
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,541
Watch it!

291
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,884
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

292
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,640
Or the biggest.

293
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:42,554
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

294
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:44,430
I thought you'd never ask.

295
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:48,934
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

296
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:02,075
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

297
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:04,744
This low gravity'll make you soft.

298
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:07,746
You get soft,

299
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:14,256
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

300
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:17,924
I pulled your record, Corporal.

301
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:20,427
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

302
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,676
Nothing like this here, though.

303
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:30,314
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

304
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,269
I figured it's just another hellhole.

305
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:34,775
I was First Recon myself.

306
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:38,108
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

307
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:41,946
3 tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

308
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,490
I come out here?

309
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:47,581
Day 1.
Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

310
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:52,206
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

311
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:57,959
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

312
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:00,930
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

313
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:05,547
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.

314
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:08,811
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

315
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:13,155
However, it does present an opportunity

316
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,855
both timely and unique.

317
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:17,612
-Clear!
-Clear!

318
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:27,911
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

319
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,666
Give me the goose bumps.

320
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:33,162
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

321
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:34,957
right on the ground.

322
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:38,167
Right in the hostiles' camp.

323
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:41,830
Look, Sully. I want you to

324
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,301
learn these savages from the inside.

325
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:46,057
I want you to gain their trust.

326
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:47,892
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

327
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,511
or hammer them hard if they won't.

328
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:54,230
-Am I still with Augustine?
-On paper.

329
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,439
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

330
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,532
but you report to me.

331
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:04,736
Can you do that for me, son?

332
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,705
Hell, yeah, sir.

333
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:10,367
Well, all right, then.

334
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:24,298
Son, I take care of my own.

335
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:25,510
You get me what I need,

336
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,844
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

337
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,228
Your real legs.

338
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,980
That sounds real good, sir.

339
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:45,362
-Link's ready!
-Phase-lock 40%.

340
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:49,078
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

341
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:52,705
I have 5 congruencies.
Phase-lock 90%.

342
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,079
Link 3 ready.

343
00:23:54,795 --> 00:23:56,419
All right, I'm going in.

344
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,821
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

345
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:16,037
-Norm! Your pack.
-Pack.

346
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:22,661
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

347
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:26,801
You the man, Doc.

348
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:06,459
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

349
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:12,546
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

350
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:20,719
So, how will they know we're here?

351
00:26:20,857 --> 00:26:23,478
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

352
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:27,902
-Keep moving, Norm.
-Keep up, guys!

353
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:33,907
-And here I go.
-Scanning.

354
00:26:37,582 --> 00:26:39,497
It's that fast?

355
00:26:41,794 --> 00:26:43,834
-Amazing, isn't it?
-Yeah.

356
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:47,712
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

357
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:51,425
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

358
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:53,179
Okay. Sample.

359
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:59,435
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

360
00:27:00,146 --> 00:27:04,060
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

361
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:06,269
Right.

362
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:35,965
So, here I go.

363
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:05,289
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

364
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:10,626
It's already pissed off.

365
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:13,718
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

366
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,680
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

367
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:26,063
So, what do I do, dance with it?

368
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:29,602
Just hold your ground.

369
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,075
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

370
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:50,211
Yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

371
00:28:51,257 --> 00:28:53,582
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

372
00:28:55,177 --> 00:28:57,715
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

373
00:28:57,847 --> 00:29:00,717
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

374
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:03,804
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends?

375
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:08,054
Shit.

376
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,318
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

377
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:25,782
Run! Definitely run!

378
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,595
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.

379
00:33:13,727 --> 00:33:16,562
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

380
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:21,559
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to
hang on till morning.

381
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:23,235
He won't make it till morning.

382
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:18,091
I don't have all goddamn night.

383
00:35:18,977 --> 00:35:21,053
Come on! Come on!

384
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:36,630
Hey, wait. Don't!

385
00:36:40,224 --> 00:36:41,255
Great.

386
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:42,282
Look, I know you probably don't
understand this,

387
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:49,580
but thank you.

388
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,174
Thank you.

389
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,638
That was pretty impressive.

390
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:07,304
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was...

391
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,976
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

392
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:16,438
Wait up!

393
00:38:17,238 --> 00:38:18,981
Just... Hey, slow down.

394
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:22,115
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

395
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:26,286
-Damn!
-Don't thank.

396
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:29,531
You don't thank for this.

397
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,036
This is sad. Very sad only.

398
00:38:36,006 --> 00:38:38,082
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

399
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:40,711
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

400
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:47,384
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

401
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,303
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

402
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:52,062
Your fault!

403
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,269
-Your fault!
-Easy. Easy.

404
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:59,019
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

405
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:00,565
Easy.

406
00:39:02,866 --> 00:39:05,239
Fine. Fine.

407
00:39:06,495 --> 00:39:08,535
If you love your little forest friends,

408
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:11,957
why not let them just kill my ass?

409
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:14,709
What's the thinking?

410
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:18,215
-Why save you?
-Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

411
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,629
You have a strong heart.

412
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:27,963
No fear.

413
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:35,356
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

414
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,188
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

415
00:39:44,908 --> 00:39:47,031
Look, maybe you should teach me.

416
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:49,367
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

417
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:51,288
Well, then teach me how to See.

418
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:53,349
No one can teach you to See.

419
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:57,660
Look, come on, can't we talk?

420
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,498
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

421
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:09,055
You're like a baby.

422
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:16,849
I need your help.

423
00:40:17,941 --> 00:40:19,768
You should not be here.

424
00:40:20,777 --> 00:40:23,565
-Okay, take me with you.
-No! Go back.

425
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:27,279
No.

426
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:29,983
Go back.

427
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:52,637
No!

428
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:15,612
What...

429
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:20,920
What are they?

430
00:41:22,297 --> 00:41:24,254
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

431
00:41:25,342 --> 00:41:26,966
Very pure spirits.

432
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,985
What was that all about?

433
00:41:55,163 --> 00:41:56,194
Come.

434
00:41:57,707 --> 00:41:58,739
Come!

435
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:02,662
Where are we going?

436
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:13,968
Come.

437
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:20,353
What's your name?

438
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,511
Shit!

439
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,079
Okay.

440
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:53,631
Calm people, calm.

441
00:42:59,394 --> 00:43:02,181
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

442
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:07,526
These demons are forbidden here.

443
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:10,645
There has been a sign.

444
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,069
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

445
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:18,861
Bring him.

446
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,076
What's going on?

447
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,492
Wait.

448
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:30,084
What's happening?

449
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,004
Hey!

450
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:43,366
Father...

451
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,033
I see you.

452
00:44:57,845 --> 00:44:59,221
This creature...

453
00:44:59,555 --> 00:45:02,592
why do you bring him here?

454
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,435
I was going to kill him...

455
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,561
but there was a sign from Eywa.

456
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:09,729
I have said...

457
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:12,016
no dreamwalker will come here.

458
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:13,590
What's he saying?

459
00:45:13,986 --> 00:45:16,394
His alien smell fills my nose.

460
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:17,526
Hey, what's he saying?

461
00:45:17,657 --> 00:45:20,408
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

462
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:24,828
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

463
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,870
Step back!

464
00:45:32,088 --> 00:45:35,207
I will look at this alien.

465
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:36,883
That is Mother.

466
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:40,924
She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

467
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:43,134
Who's Eywa?

468
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:51,730
What are you called?

469
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:54,062
Jake Sully.

470
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,746
-Why did you come to us?
-I came to learn.

471
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,083
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

472
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,544
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

473
00:46:16,048 --> 00:46:18,337
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

474
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:22,256
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

475
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:23,763
What are you?

476
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:29,261
I was a Marine. A...

477
00:46:30,146 --> 00:46:32,767
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

478
00:46:33,232 --> 00:46:34,430
A warrior!

479
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:35,977
I could kill him easily!

480
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,272
-I could kill him easily!
-No!

481
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,948
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

482
00:46:42,074 --> 00:46:43,901
we have seen.

483
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,786
We need to learn more about him.

484
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,116
My Daughter...

485
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:55,497
you will teach him our way...

486
00:46:55,629 --> 00:46:58,998
to speak and walk as we do.

487
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:02,668
Why me? That's not fair...

488
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:07,634
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

489
00:47:07,766 --> 00:47:11,301
Learn well, Jakesully.

490
00:47:12,146 --> 00:47:15,930
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

491
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:36,127
Good evening.

492
00:47:39,173 --> 00:47:40,916
Please don't get up.

493
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:44,123
Excuse me.

494
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:47,586
Sorry.

495
00:47:50,726 --> 00:47:52,434
Hey, how you doing?

496
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:38,388
-Jake. Jake!
-He's in alpha.

497
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:41,524
-He's coming out right now.
-Jake. Jake!

498
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:46,404
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

499
00:48:48,116 --> 00:48:50,738
There you go. There you go, there you go.

500
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:53,194
You're okay. You're okay.

501
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,201
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

502
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,874
-Is the avatar safe?
-Yeah, Doc.

503
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:05,711
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

504
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,714
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

505
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:13,844
disappearing into the brush with
this angry thanator coming after him.

506
00:49:13,976 --> 00:49:16,893
-Hey, it's not something you can teach.
-That is awesome.

507
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,309
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

508
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:22,689
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

509
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:25,516
"Jarhead clan"?

510
00:49:27,155 --> 00:49:30,156
-And it worked?
-Hey, I'm practically family.

511
00:49:31,284 --> 00:49:34,700
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

512
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,372
That's called taking the initiative, son.

513
00:49:36,498 --> 00:49:38,954
-I wish I had 10 more like you.
-Look, Sully. Sully.

514
00:49:39,084 --> 00:49:42,453
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

515
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:46,266
You know, I mean, we try
to give them medicine,

516
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:47,726
education,

517
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,927
roads. But no, no,
they like mud.

518
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,922
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're...

519
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,595
Hey, can you... Can somebody just...
Sector 12.

520
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,517
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

521
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:05,726
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

522
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:07,739
Their damn village

523
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:11,899
happens to be resting on
the richest unobtanium deposit

524
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:14,936
within 200 klicks in any direction.

525
00:50:15,036 --> 00:50:17,845
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

526
00:50:21,126 --> 00:50:23,617
-Well, who gets them to move?
-Guess.

527
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:29,046
-What if they won't go?
-I'm betting that they will.

528
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,262
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

529
00:50:33,138 --> 00:50:35,973
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

530
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:39,800
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

531
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:43,056
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

532
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:46,309
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

533
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,146
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

534
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,481
You got 3 months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

535
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,527
Well, we're wasting time.

536
00:50:57,537 --> 00:50:58,616
I like this guy.

537
00:50:58,872 --> 00:51:02,241
-Guys, right now...
-Okay, let's run through them again.

538
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,664
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

539
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:09,667
-Eytucan.
-Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

540
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:12,884
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

541
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:14,553
Got it.

542
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:16,838
-T'su'tey.
-Tsu'tey.

543
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,678
-Tsu'tey.
-He'll be the next clan leader.

544
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:24,183
-Neytiri.
-She'll be the next Tsahik.

545
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,223
They become a mated pair.

546
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:29,564
-So who's this Eywa?
-Who's Eywa?

547
00:51:30,528 --> 00:51:34,063
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

548
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:35,527
Everything they know!

549
00:51:35,658 --> 00:51:37,698
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

550
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:39,156
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

551
00:51:39,287 --> 00:51:40,912
-Come on. That's...
-All right, knock it off, you two.

552
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,530
Let's go. Village life starts early.

553
00:51:45,752 --> 00:51:48,207
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

554
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:08,554
Easy, boy.

555
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:11,273
Pale is female.

556
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,652
Okay. Easy, girl.

557
00:52:45,478 --> 00:52:49,179
That is tsaheylu. The bond.

558
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,599
Feel her.

559
00:52:55,822 --> 00:52:59,866
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

560
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:04,655
Feel her strong legs.

561
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,455
You may tell her what to do.

562
00:53:09,585 --> 00:53:10,748
Inside.

563
00:53:11,754 --> 00:53:14,625
For now, say where to go.

564
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:18,875
Forward!

565
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:39,613
-You should go away.
-No, you'd miss me.

566
00:53:41,075 --> 00:53:43,317
I knew you could speak English.

567
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:47,948
This alien will learn nothing...

568
00:53:48,457 --> 00:53:50,000
a rock sees more...

569
00:53:50,459 --> 00:53:52,251
look at him.

570
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:02,716
Again.

571
00:54:02,847 --> 00:54:06,263
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

572
00:54:06,392 --> 00:54:08,848
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

573
00:54:08,978 --> 00:54:10,971
There's an outer row of columns.

574
00:54:11,105 --> 00:54:13,810
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

575
00:54:13,941 --> 00:54:17,524
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

576
00:54:18,404 --> 00:54:20,029
That's how they move up and down.

577
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,943
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

578
00:54:23,075 --> 00:54:24,356
Roger that.

579
00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:27,115
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

580
00:54:27,246 --> 00:54:30,033
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

581
00:54:34,587 --> 00:54:38,038
-So where are we going?
-Getting out of Dodge.

582
00:54:39,425 --> 00:54:43,553
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

583
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:46,882
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

584
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:48,925
way up in the mountains.

585
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:52,016
The Hallelujah Mountains?

586
00:54:52,146 --> 00:54:54,388
-That's right.
-Are you serious?

587
00:54:54,523 --> 00:54:56,397
-Yeah.
-Yes!

588
00:54:59,904 --> 00:55:03,569
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

589
00:55:17,129 --> 00:55:18,921
We're getting close.

590
00:55:19,048 --> 00:55:21,669
Yeah, look at my instruments.

591
00:55:21,801 --> 00:55:24,718
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

592
00:55:24,845 --> 00:55:27,052
We're VFR from here on.

593
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:29,008
What's VFR?

594
00:55:29,141 --> 00:55:31,430
Means you gotta see where you're going.

595
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,428
-You can't see anything.
-Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

596
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:56,573
My God.

597
00:56:07,638 --> 00:56:08,966
You should see your faces.

598
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,580
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

599
00:56:57,146 --> 00:56:58,688
Welcome to camp.

600
00:57:02,568 --> 00:57:07,194
-So, this is my bunk.
-This stuff is nasty.

601
00:57:08,574 --> 00:57:10,531
-Norm, go under.
-All right.

602
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:14,110
-Grace didn't miss a thing.
-Trudy, you'll take the top one.

603
00:57:14,246 --> 00:57:16,618
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

604
00:57:16,748 --> 00:57:20,331
But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,

605
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,038
so she's playing nice.

606
00:57:22,171 --> 00:57:27,165
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

607
00:57:30,095 --> 00:57:34,140
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

608
00:58:23,398 --> 00:58:24,679
Holy shit!

609
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,477
Do not look in her eye.

610
00:58:36,078 --> 00:58:37,785
Ikran is not horse.

611
00:58:38,955 --> 00:58:40,782
Once tsaheylu is made,

612
00:58:44,669 --> 00:58:48,963
ikran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life.

613
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:01,638
To become taronyu, hunter,

614
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:05,305
you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you.

615
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:09,894
-When?
-When you are ready.

616
01:00:00,328 --> 01:00:03,448
Okay. This is video log 12.

617
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,326
Time's 2132.

618
01:00:07,794 --> 01:00:11,127
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack.

619
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:14,043
No, now. When it's fresh.

620
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:18,553
Okay, location, shack,

621
01:00:19,556 --> 01:00:21,881
and the days are starting to blur together.

622
01:00:24,018 --> 01:00:27,185
The language is a pain, but, you know,

623
01:00:27,313 --> 01:00:30,433
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition.

624
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:32,040
-Na vi.
-"Nari."

625
01:00:32,277 --> 01:00:34,466
-Nari.
-"Narrri"!

626
01:00:34,612 --> 01:00:35,810
Narrri!

627
01:00:36,781 --> 01:00:38,774
Txur ni'ul. Stronger.

628
01:00:43,455 --> 01:00:47,073
Neytiri calls m e skxawng. It means moron.

629
01:00:49,419 --> 01:00:50,830
This is a very important part of it.

630
01:00:50,962 --> 01:00:53,038
-Norm's attitude has improved lately.
-I see you. I see you.

631
01:00:53,173 --> 01:00:55,498
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

632
01:00:55,633 --> 01:00:57,258
it's "I see into you. I See you."

633
01:00:57,385 --> 01:00:59,958
It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

634
01:01:00,096 --> 01:01:02,302
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

635
01:01:02,682 --> 01:01:05,599
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

636
01:01:06,436 --> 01:01:09,971
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day.

637
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,984
I have to trust my body
to know what to do.

638
01:01:20,158 --> 01:01:21,818
Yeah! Check it out!

639
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:23,905
Crap!

640
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:33,035
Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,

641
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:35,329
the tiniest scents and sounds.

642
01:01:40,928 --> 01:01:45,674
She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

643
01:01:46,517 --> 01:01:49,139
I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final.

644
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:52,888
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know.

645
01:01:53,024 --> 01:01:55,645
You need to listen to what she says.

646
01:01:55,777 --> 01:01:58,896
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

647
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,568
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

648
01:02:17,006 --> 01:02:19,544
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

649
01:02:20,885 --> 01:02:22,961
You gotta be kidding me.

650
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:54,159
I talked Mo'at into
letting Grace into the village.

651
01:02:54,293 --> 01:02:56,963
Look how big you are.

652
01:02:57,171 --> 01:02:58,126
It's the first time
since her school was closed down.

653
01:02:58,256 --> 01:02:59,838
You are so pretty.

654
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:04,129
No, you don't. Come back here.

655
01:03:05,972 --> 01:03:07,003
Bon appйtit.

656
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:36,203
Come on, Marine.

657
01:04:01,485 --> 01:04:04,107
I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

658
01:04:04,238 --> 01:04:06,444
the people have to the forest.

659
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:09,736
She talks about a network of energy

660
01:04:10,578 --> 01:04:13,116
that flows through all living things.

661
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:17,325
She says all energy is only borrowed,

662
01:04:18,294 --> 01:04:20,832
and one day you have to give it back.

663
01:04:43,777 --> 01:04:44,809
I see you...

664
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:46,102
Brother

665
01:04:46,614 --> 01:04:48,772
and thank you.

666
01:04:52,953 --> 01:04:54,780
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

667
01:04:55,456 --> 01:04:57,164
Your body stays behind...

668
01:04:57,499 --> 01:05:00,121
to become part of The People.

669
01:05:03,922 --> 01:05:05,333
A clean kill.

670
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:10,178
You are ready.

671
01:05:35,871 --> 01:05:39,205
Learning to ride an ikran,
we call them banshees,

672
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:41,871
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

673
01:05:44,129 --> 01:05:47,415
But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are.

674
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,463
Oo-rah.

675
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:22,244
Now what?

676
01:07:52,257 --> 01:07:54,166
Jakesully will go first.

677
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:31,033
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside.

678
01:08:32,005 --> 01:08:34,922
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

679
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:37,837
You will have one chance, Jake.

680
01:08:37,969 --> 01:08:40,045
How will I know if he chooses me?

681
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,089
He will try to kill you.

682
01:08:43,308 --> 01:08:44,683
Outstanding.

683
01:09:44,994 --> 01:09:46,370
Let's dance.

684
01:09:52,502 --> 01:09:54,329
That moron's going to die.

685
01:10:18,278 --> 01:10:19,985
Don't be afraid, warrior.

686
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:21,613
Make the bond!

687
01:10:25,076 --> 01:10:26,072
No!

688
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:31,112
Jake!

689
01:10:45,221 --> 01:10:46,763
Tsaheylu, Jake.

690
01:10:49,183 --> 01:10:50,381
Tsaheylu!

691
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:01,601
Stop!

692
01:11:10,288 --> 01:11:15,052
Yeah, that's right. You're mine.

693
01:11:28,639 --> 01:11:31,510
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

694
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,219
-Think, "Fly!"
-Fly?

695
01:11:43,863 --> 01:11:45,108
God damn!

696
01:11:49,535 --> 01:11:50,780
Shit!

697
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:02,413
Shut up and fly straight!

698
01:12:12,683 --> 01:12:14,972
That's it. Bank left!

699
01:12:24,362 --> 01:12:26,105
Level out! That's it.

700
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:32,899
Jakesully!

701
01:12:57,728 --> 01:12:58,759
Hey!

702
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,105
Let's go!

703
01:13:18,582 --> 01:13:20,456
Yeah, baby, I got this!

704
01:13:21,335 --> 01:13:22,533
Shit!

705
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:31,590
I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this.

706
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:33,550
Yeah!

707
01:13:34,556 --> 01:13:37,593
-I came like this. This you.
-Yeah, yeah.

708
01:13:37,726 --> 01:13:41,131
I turn. I feel the wind.
I turn very strong.

709
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:43,206
Look, yeah, see,
I banked so hard...

710
01:14:44,793 --> 01:14:46,750
The Tree of Souls.

711
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:52,332
It's their most sacred place.

712
01:14:53,177 --> 01:14:55,964
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

713
01:14:56,096 --> 01:14:58,136
Yeah, that's what messes up
my instruments.

714
01:14:58,265 --> 01:15:02,761
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

715
01:15:04,188 --> 01:15:06,227
I would die to get samples.

716
01:15:06,857 --> 01:15:09,644
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

717
01:15:09,776 --> 01:15:11,152
You lucky swine.

718
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:22,111
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above.

719
01:15:23,498 --> 01:15:26,452
Only problem is, you're not the only one.

720
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,459
Dive!

721
01:15:54,237 --> 01:15:55,400
Go, go!

722
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:04,902
Follow me!

723
01:16:51,419 --> 01:16:53,957
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

724
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:57,918
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

725
01:16:59,678 --> 01:17:02,762
Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.

726
01:17:07,435 --> 01:17:11,136
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto.

727
01:17:11,856 --> 01:17:13,600
Rider of Last Shadow.

728
01:17:15,026 --> 01:17:16,437
He rode this?

729
01:17:18,154 --> 01:17:19,697
Toruk chose him.

730
01:17:20,115 --> 01:17:23,947
It has only happened 5 times
since the time of the First Songs.

731
01:17:24,077 --> 01:17:25,986
-That's a long time.
-Yes.

732
01:17:26,746 --> 01:17:28,620
Toruk Macto was mighty.

733
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,201
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

734
01:17:34,337 --> 01:17:36,626
All Na'vi people know the story.

735
01:17:43,346 --> 01:17:47,510
Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world

736
01:17:48,685 --> 01:17:50,642
and in here is the dream.

737
01:18:11,207 --> 01:18:13,877
It's hard to believe
it's only been 3 months.

738
01:18:17,005 --> 01:18:19,377
I can barely remember my old life.

739
01:18:22,969 --> 01:18:24,796
I don't know who I am anymore.

740
01:18:43,573 --> 01:18:46,360
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

741
01:18:49,579 --> 01:18:52,496
Your last report was
more than 2 weeks ago.

742
01:18:54,751 --> 01:18:57,206
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

743
01:18:59,797 --> 01:19:02,288
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

744
01:19:02,425 --> 01:19:04,216
No, I can do this.

745
01:19:04,344 --> 01:19:05,921
You already have.

746
01:19:06,929 --> 01:19:09,088
You give me good, usable intel.

747
01:19:09,223 --> 01:19:11,382
This Tree of Souls place.

748
01:19:11,851 --> 01:19:15,220
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

749
01:19:15,355 --> 01:19:17,063
which it will. Yeah.

750
01:19:18,024 --> 01:19:19,981
Now it's time to come in.

751
01:19:21,486 --> 01:19:23,359
By the way,

752
01:19:23,905 --> 01:19:25,862
you gonna get your legs back.

753
01:19:26,783 --> 01:19:30,317
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

754
01:19:30,453 --> 01:19:32,861
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

755
01:19:32,997 --> 01:19:34,741
I'm a man of my word.

756
01:19:37,668 --> 01:19:39,412
I gotta finish this.

757
01:19:41,714 --> 01:19:43,256
There's one more thing.

758
01:19:43,966 --> 01:19:48,924
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

759
01:19:51,474 --> 01:19:53,550
If I do it, I'm one of them.

760
01:19:55,061 --> 01:19:56,804
And they'll trust me.

761
01:20:00,483 --> 01:20:03,650
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

762
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,789
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

763
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:41,178
The Na'vi say that
every person is born twice.

764
01:20:43,234 --> 01:20:49,072
The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever.

765
01:20:53,953 --> 01:20:58,449
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

766
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:02,917
You are part of The People.

767
01:21:49,258 --> 01:21:51,215
Come. Come.

768
01:22:08,861 --> 01:22:11,566
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

769
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:15,072
And sometimes answered.

770
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:25,580
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

771
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:28,337
The Tree of Voices.

772
01:22:30,424 --> 01:22:32,500
The voices of our ancestors.

773
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:49,108
I can hear them.

774
01:22:54,114 --> 01:22:55,656
They live, Jake,

775
01:22:57,785 --> 01:22:59,113
within Eywa.

776
01:23:03,332 --> 01:23:05,159
You are Omaticaya now.

777
01:23:05,959 --> 01:23:08,996
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

778
01:23:14,676 --> 01:23:16,716
And you may choose a woman.

779
01:23:18,889 --> 01:23:20,798
We have many fine women.

780
01:23:22,059 --> 01:23:24,016
Ninat is the best singer.

781
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:28,812
But I don't want Ninat.

782
01:23:33,153 --> 01:23:35,062
Peyral is a good hunter.

783
01:23:36,782 --> 01:23:38,821
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

784
01:23:40,953 --> 01:23:42,661
I've already chosen.

785
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:48,663
But this woman must also choose me.

786
01:23:52,714 --> 01:23:54,292
She already has.

787
01:24:24,913 --> 01:24:26,822
I am with you now, Jake.

788
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:30,243
We are mated for life.

789
01:24:36,633 --> 01:24:38,626
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

790
01:25:09,374 --> 01:25:10,489
Ma Jake!

791
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:11,823
Don't forget your phase integration.

792
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,288
-Jake!
-No, no, the middle button.

793
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:15,247
-You gotta eat something.
-Yeah, there you go.

794
01:25:23,722 --> 01:25:28,680
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

795
01:25:29,352 --> 01:25:31,808
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

796
01:25:32,981 --> 01:25:34,523
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

797
01:25:38,403 --> 01:25:39,434
Jake!

798
01:25:48,413 --> 01:25:49,492
Okay.

799
01:26:00,592 --> 01:26:02,584
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

800
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:04,925
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

801
01:26:05,055 --> 01:26:07,047
-I don't need a shower.
-Jesus, Marine.

802
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,467
Jake!

803
01:26:19,277 --> 01:26:24,235
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

804
01:26:27,744 --> 01:26:29,024
Hey!

805
01:26:29,788 --> 01:26:32,160
Stop! Stop!

806
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:35,042
-Jake!
-Go back, stop!

807
01:26:39,297 --> 01:26:40,578
Hey, boss.

808
01:26:41,091 --> 01:26:42,253
Hey!

809
01:26:44,844 --> 01:26:45,923
-What?
-I got a native

810
01:26:46,054 --> 01:26:48,924
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

811
01:26:49,057 --> 01:26:52,141
Well, keep going. He'll move.

812
01:26:52,268 --> 01:26:55,472
These people have to learn that
we don't stop. Come on, go, go.

813
01:26:57,857 --> 01:27:00,016
Stop! Hey!

814
01:27:00,151 --> 01:27:02,440
Go! Go!

815
01:27:03,488 --> 01:27:04,863
There, see? He moved.

816
01:27:17,293 --> 01:27:18,953
Dude, dude. Dude! Dude, no!

817
01:27:19,921 --> 01:27:21,201
I'm blind.

818
01:27:33,101 --> 01:27:35,307
-Jake!
-Neytiri!

819
01:27:36,938 --> 01:27:38,562
Here, come on!

820
01:28:03,548 --> 01:28:06,039
Freeze it right there.

821
01:28:07,677 --> 01:28:10,084
Scale up. Enhance.

822
01:28:11,764 --> 01:28:13,258
Son of a bitch.

823
01:28:14,809 --> 01:28:16,220
Unbelievable.

824
01:28:17,353 --> 01:28:19,429
-Get me a pilot.
-Yes, sir.

825
01:28:26,237 --> 01:28:28,526
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

826
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:36,277
Stop please!

827
01:28:37,915 --> 01:28:39,872
This will only make it worse.

828
01:28:40,084 --> 01:28:41,709
You do not speak here!

829
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,747
We will strike them in the heart.

830
01:28:52,513 --> 01:28:54,636
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

831
01:28:57,810 --> 01:28:59,304
-You!
-Listen. Brother...

832
01:29:04,817 --> 01:29:07,937
-You mated with this woman?
-Shit.

833
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,189
Is this true?

834
01:29:12,783 --> 01:29:15,903
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

835
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:18,444
Brother, please.

836
01:29:18,581 --> 01:29:22,329
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

837
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:24,702
You are not my brother!

838
01:29:27,965 --> 01:29:29,673
And I am not your enemy!

839
01:29:31,344 --> 01:29:34,179
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

840
01:29:36,474 --> 01:29:38,217
Go! Go! Go!

841
01:29:41,479 --> 01:29:43,886
-I can talk to them.
-No more talk.

842
01:29:44,023 --> 01:29:45,351
Tsu'tey!

843
01:29:51,614 --> 01:29:54,484
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

844
01:29:55,326 --> 01:29:57,532
And I have the right to speak.

845
01:30:02,124 --> 01:30:04,033
I have something to say...

846
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:07,914
to all of you.

847
01:30:11,926 --> 01:30:13,965
The words are like stones in my heart.

848
01:30:18,349 --> 01:30:20,258
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

849
01:30:20,392 --> 01:30:22,599
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

850
01:30:23,813 --> 01:30:25,141
It's very dangerous!

851
01:30:27,775 --> 01:30:28,889
Grace!

852
01:30:30,194 --> 01:30:31,309
No.

853
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:33,527
-Wait!
-Stay down, sir.

854
01:30:35,074 --> 01:30:37,316
Okay. Look...

855
01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:39,691
I was sent here to...

856
01:30:43,374 --> 01:30:44,749
You see?

857
01:30:44,959 --> 01:30:47,532
It is a demon in a false body.

858
01:31:07,314 --> 01:31:10,683
-Are you out of your goddamn mind?
-You crossed the line.

859
01:31:14,154 --> 01:31:16,277
Wheel this meat out of here.

860
01:31:18,075 --> 01:31:20,566
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

861
01:31:23,831 --> 01:31:25,574
You let me down, son.

862
01:31:27,626 --> 01:31:28,824
So, what,

863
01:31:30,379 --> 01:31:32,336
you find yourself some local tail

864
01:31:32,464 --> 01:31:35,584
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

865
01:31:35,718 --> 01:31:38,209
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

866
01:31:38,345 --> 01:31:40,801
-Parker...
-Shut your pie hole!

867
01:31:40,931 --> 01:31:45,095
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

868
01:31:45,227 --> 01:31:47,932
-I could do that.
-You need to muzzle your dog.

869
01:31:48,063 --> 01:31:50,768
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

870
01:31:50,899 --> 01:31:53,307
You say you want to
keep your people alive?

871
01:31:53,444 --> 01:31:55,436
You start by listening to her.

872
01:31:55,571 --> 01:31:57,777
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

873
01:31:57,906 --> 01:31:59,650
-in a way you can't imagine.
-You know what?

874
01:31:59,783 --> 01:32:02,025
You throw a stick in the air around here,

875
01:32:02,161 --> 01:32:05,115
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

876
01:32:05,247 --> 01:32:06,527
-for Christ's sake!
-I'm not talking

877
01:32:06,665 --> 01:32:11,042
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

878
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:13,791
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

879
01:32:13,922 --> 01:32:15,333
Which is what, exactly?

880
01:32:16,425 --> 01:32:17,705
What we think we know

881
01:32:17,843 --> 01:32:21,176
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

882
01:32:21,305 --> 01:32:25,634
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

883
01:32:25,767 --> 01:32:30,311
And each tree has 10-to-the-4th
connections to the trees around it.

884
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:33,605
And there are 10-to-the-12th trees
on Pandora.

885
01:32:34,526 --> 01:32:36,733
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

886
01:32:36,862 --> 01:32:39,187
It's more connections
than the human brain.

887
01:32:40,407 --> 01:32:42,898
Get it? It's a network.

888
01:32:43,035 --> 01:32:45,989
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

889
01:32:46,121 --> 01:32:49,572
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

890
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:52,377
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

891
01:32:53,045 --> 01:32:54,040
Yes!

892
01:32:55,297 --> 01:32:59,377
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

893
01:33:00,052 --> 01:33:02,128
They're just goddamn trees!

894
01:33:03,889 --> 01:33:06,594
-You need to wake up, Parker.
-No. You need to wake up.

895
01:33:06,725 --> 01:33:11,186
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

896
01:33:11,313 --> 01:33:14,978
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

897
01:33:15,108 --> 01:33:19,355
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

898
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:24,114
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

899
01:33:25,911 --> 01:33:28,318
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

900
01:33:28,455 --> 01:33:30,613
They're not gonna give up their home.

901
01:33:32,459 --> 01:33:34,083
They're not gonna make a deal.

902
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:37,412
For what? Lite beer?

903
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:39,548
And blue jeans?

904
01:33:42,844 --> 01:33:45,715
There's nothing that we have
that they want.

905
01:33:47,641 --> 01:33:50,642
Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time.

906
01:33:55,607 --> 01:33:57,481
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

907
01:33:59,945 --> 01:34:01,197
So,

908
01:34:01,717 --> 01:34:05,900
since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

909
01:34:06,117 --> 01:34:10,578
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

910
01:34:10,705 --> 01:34:13,243
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

911
01:34:20,298 --> 01:34:23,632
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

912
01:34:24,594 --> 01:34:27,050
I'll drive them out with gas first.

913
01:34:28,306 --> 01:34:29,884
It'll be humane.

914
01:34:31,518 --> 01:34:32,929
More or less.

915
01:34:34,688 --> 01:34:36,514
All right, let's pull the trigger.

916
01:34:40,151 --> 01:34:42,061
-Come on, people.
-Man.

917
01:34:42,195 --> 01:34:43,855
Let's pack it up, let's go.

918
01:34:43,989 --> 01:34:45,780
This is how it's done.

919
01:34:48,827 --> 01:34:52,112
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

920
01:34:52,247 --> 01:34:56,245
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

921
01:34:56,376 --> 01:34:59,792
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

922
01:34:59,921 --> 01:35:00,917
My God.

923
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:11,384
-Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
-Back off!

924
01:35:11,516 --> 01:35:15,181
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to...

925
01:35:15,311 --> 01:35:16,343
-No. No, no...
-I said back off!

926
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:19,848
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

927
01:35:19,983 --> 01:35:21,643
All right? Look around!

928
01:35:21,776 --> 01:35:25,441
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

929
01:35:25,572 --> 01:35:26,982
-Can you guys just please...
-Yes, sir.

930
01:35:27,115 --> 01:35:29,570
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

931
01:35:29,701 --> 01:35:30,946
Are you gonna kill children?

932
01:35:31,077 --> 01:35:34,945
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

933
01:35:35,081 --> 01:35:37,406
Just let me try to talk them out.

934
01:35:38,251 --> 01:35:39,710
They trust me.

935
01:35:43,047 --> 01:35:45,420
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

936
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:47,424
Calibrating 3 and 4.

937
01:35:47,552 --> 01:35:50,469
-Run sequence.
-Initiating. 30 seconds.

938
01:35:54,893 --> 01:35:56,553
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

939
01:35:56,686 --> 01:35:59,224
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

940
01:35:59,355 --> 01:36:01,929
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

941
01:36:07,864 --> 01:36:09,062
Father!

942
01:36:09,282 --> 01:36:10,278
Mother!

943
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:13,616
Eytukan, I have something to say.

944
01:36:13,786 --> 01:36:15,031
Listen!

945
01:36:16,164 --> 01:36:17,623
Speak, Jakesully.

946
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,036
A great evil is upon us...

947
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,163
The Sky People are coming...

948
01:36:24,505 --> 01:36:26,913
to destroy Hometree.

949
01:36:29,427 --> 01:36:30,802
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

950
01:36:33,431 --> 01:36:36,136
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

951
01:36:36,267 --> 01:36:38,176
Are you certain of this?

952
01:36:41,981 --> 01:36:45,646
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

953
01:36:46,903 --> 01:36:50,106
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

954
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:56,283
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

955
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:00,999
Yes.

956
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:03,497
Look, at first it was just orders,

957
01:37:05,046 --> 01:37:07,335
and then everything changed.

958
01:37:07,465 --> 01:37:09,208
Okay? I fell in love.

959
01:37:09,884 --> 01:37:11,811
I fell in love with

960
01:37:12,011 --> 01:37:15,752
the forest and with
the Omaticaya people.

961
01:37:16,349 --> 01:37:17,760
And with you.

962
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:20,601
-I trusted you.
-With you. With you.

963
01:37:20,728 --> 01:37:23,515
-I trusted you!
-Trust me now, please.

964
01:37:30,947 --> 01:37:33,319
You will never be one of The People!

965
01:37:33,449 --> 01:37:35,193
-I shouldn't have...
-We tried to stop them!

966
01:37:35,326 --> 01:37:37,283
Neytiri, please! Please.

967
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:43,323
Bind them.

968
01:37:45,127 --> 01:37:46,159
Leave now!

969
01:37:46,337 --> 01:37:49,623
You have to go. They're coming!

970
01:38:03,521 --> 01:38:05,679
Time on target, 1 mike.

971
01:38:05,815 --> 01:38:07,724
Copy. We have a visual.

972
01:38:07,858 --> 01:38:10,812
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

973
01:38:10,945 --> 01:38:12,273
Roger, 030.

974
01:38:26,085 --> 01:38:28,078
-Run to the forest!
-They're coming!

975
01:38:29,755 --> 01:38:33,539
-They will destroy this place.
-Neytiri, you must go now!

976
01:38:37,388 --> 01:38:39,630
Run to the forest! Run!

977
01:38:42,059 --> 01:38:43,340
Run! Run!

978
01:38:43,519 --> 01:38:47,054
Have no fear.

979
01:39:03,914 --> 01:39:07,579
No! God damn it, run!

980
01:39:07,918 --> 01:39:09,294
Take the ikran...

981
01:39:09,462 --> 01:39:10,920
attack from above.

982
01:39:15,259 --> 01:39:17,382
That is one big damn tree.

983
01:39:24,935 --> 01:39:29,099
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

984
01:39:31,108 --> 01:39:33,184
All right, people, let's get this done!

985
01:39:33,319 --> 01:39:36,106
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

986
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:38,439
Roger.
CS .40's going hot.

987
01:39:38,616 --> 01:39:39,778
-Fire.
-Firing.

988
01:39:51,295 --> 01:39:53,252
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

989
01:40:01,263 --> 01:40:02,841
Sir, they've opened fire.

990
01:40:04,808 --> 01:40:06,468
You've got to be kidding me!

991
01:40:19,073 --> 01:40:21,564
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

992
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,325
All right, let's turn up the heat.

993
01:40:23,452 --> 01:40:26,323
-Switch incendiaries!
-Switching incendiaries.

994
01:40:26,455 --> 01:40:27,486
Fire.

995
01:40:30,834 --> 01:40:31,866
No!

996
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:46,848
Get everyone to the forest.

997
01:40:50,312 --> 01:40:52,470
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

998
01:40:56,235 --> 01:40:57,433
Neytiri!

999
01:41:06,161 --> 01:41:09,162
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

1000
01:41:09,289 --> 01:41:10,487
My God!

1001
01:41:29,101 --> 01:41:32,434
-Mo'at! No!
-If you are one of us,

1002
01:41:33,981 --> 01:41:35,309
help us.

1003
01:41:43,073 --> 01:41:45,030
All call signs, switch missiles.

1004
01:41:45,242 --> 01:41:47,649
Give me HE's at the base
of the west columns.

1005
01:41:49,621 --> 01:41:50,866
This way!

1006
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,867
Rider section, switch missiles.

1007
01:41:54,001 --> 01:41:55,874
-1's good.
-2's rocks up.

1008
01:41:56,003 --> 01:41:58,540
-3's up.
-Yeah, baby, get some!

1009
01:41:59,089 --> 01:42:01,331
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.

1010
01:42:01,466 --> 01:42:02,795
-Bring it down.
-Cleared hot.

1011
01:42:09,933 --> 01:42:11,427
Come on, Grace, move!

1012
01:42:14,104 --> 01:42:15,682
Down! Head down!

1013
01:42:18,275 --> 01:42:20,481
Come on, come on! Down!

1014
01:42:25,282 --> 01:42:27,239
-Solid hits.
-Solid rocks on target.

1015
01:42:27,367 --> 01:42:28,530
Screw this.

1016
01:42:29,786 --> 01:42:31,743
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1017
01:42:31,872 --> 01:42:33,615
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1018
01:42:43,341 --> 01:42:45,168
Repeat. Ripple fire.

1019
01:43:28,803 --> 01:43:30,298
Go! Go! Go!

1020
01:44:03,421 --> 01:44:05,829
No, no, get back! Back!

1021
01:44:24,901 --> 01:44:27,439
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1022
01:45:12,490 --> 01:45:16,073
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

1023
01:45:16,786 --> 01:45:18,031
Let's boogie.

1024
01:45:18,454 --> 01:45:20,827
Dragon coming left, heading home.

1025
01:45:21,332 --> 01:45:23,241
Gunrunner coming left.

1026
01:45:23,376 --> 01:45:25,832
-Thunder copies.
-Rider section copies.

1027
01:45:33,553 --> 01:45:34,549
Father!

1028
01:45:50,528 --> 01:45:51,691
Daughter...

1029
01:45:52,947 --> 01:45:56,150
take... my...bow.

1030
01:46:00,163 --> 01:46:04,575
Protect The People.

1031
01:46:13,009 --> 01:46:14,171
Neytiri!

1032
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:27,971
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Get away.

1033
01:46:28,691 --> 01:46:29,889
Get away!

1034
01:46:31,027 --> 01:46:32,735
Get away from here!

1035
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:35,816
Never come back!

1036
01:46:53,549 --> 01:46:54,628
Pull the plug.

1037
01:46:55,635 --> 01:46:58,208
-No, you can't do that!
-You can't do that!

1038
01:46:58,346 --> 01:47:00,255
-Calm down! Calm down!
-No! Please!

1039
01:47:16,489 --> 01:47:19,027
I was a warrior
who dreamed he could bring peace.

1040
01:47:20,451 --> 01:47:24,318
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

1041
01:47:27,166 --> 01:47:28,577
Let's go!

1042
01:47:36,467 --> 01:47:38,045
Put him down!

1043
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:44,135
You murderer!

1044
01:48:30,813 --> 01:48:32,889
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

1045
01:48:33,023 --> 01:48:34,019
Hey.

1046
01:48:35,442 --> 01:48:38,112
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1047
01:48:38,237 --> 01:48:41,522
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

1048
01:48:42,616 --> 01:48:45,107
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1049
01:48:45,244 --> 01:48:47,699
-Trudy!
-All the way down.

1050
01:48:51,166 --> 01:48:52,329
Max!

1051
01:49:02,428 --> 01:49:04,919
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1052
01:49:05,514 --> 01:49:06,593
Here.

1053
01:49:18,694 --> 01:49:21,101
-Clear. Come on.
-Here you go.

1054
01:49:36,712 --> 01:49:40,579
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1055
01:49:40,716 --> 01:49:41,914
Okay. Go.

1056
01:49:55,772 --> 01:49:56,887
Clear.

1057
01:49:58,901 --> 01:50:00,099
Come on, baby.

1058
01:50:00,235 --> 01:50:02,987
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1059
01:50:06,617 --> 01:50:09,618
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

1060
01:50:12,706 --> 01:50:13,951
3!

1061
01:50:16,835 --> 01:50:17,998
Come on!

1062
01:50:20,047 --> 01:50:21,327
Mask on!

1063
01:50:23,926 --> 01:50:25,717
Gas, gas, gas!

1064
01:50:27,387 --> 01:50:29,380
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1065
01:50:31,892 --> 01:50:35,012
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1066
01:50:36,021 --> 01:50:37,812
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1067
01:50:50,494 --> 01:50:51,774
Colonel!

1068
01:50:58,585 --> 01:51:02,036
-Yeah! Yeah!
-All right! Yes!

1069
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,921
-Crap.
-Everybody all right back there?

1070
01:51:08,053 --> 01:51:09,512
Yeah, baby!

1071
01:51:09,638 --> 01:51:11,465
-Norm, you good?
-Yeah!

1072
01:51:12,391 --> 01:51:14,679
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1073
01:51:14,976 --> 01:51:16,720
-Grace is hit!
-What?

1074
01:51:17,938 --> 01:51:19,480
-Get the trauma kit.
-Trauma kit!

1075
01:51:19,606 --> 01:51:23,057
-Keep the pressure on, Grace.
-Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1076
01:51:23,193 --> 01:51:27,606
-Hang on, Grace.
-Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1077
01:51:30,992 --> 01:51:33,400
-You're good to go.
-Take it up!

1078
01:51:34,621 --> 01:51:36,412
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

1079
01:51:40,877 --> 01:51:42,288
You're clear!

1080
01:51:50,262 --> 01:51:52,966
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1081
01:51:53,098 --> 01:51:54,473
Copy that.

1082
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:04,767
-Norm, you all good up there?
-Yep! Still here.

1083
01:52:06,653 --> 01:52:11,279
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

1084
01:52:11,408 --> 01:52:13,447
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1085
01:52:13,577 --> 01:52:14,987
Yeah.

1086
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:17,029
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1087
01:52:25,922 --> 01:52:27,037
Ouch.

1088
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:31,885
You big baby.

1089
01:52:33,263 --> 01:52:34,674
We're moving.

1090
01:52:35,265 --> 01:52:37,304
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1091
01:52:38,268 --> 01:52:40,391
I'm a scientist, remember?

1092
01:52:41,354 --> 01:52:43,762
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1093
01:52:44,649 --> 01:52:46,523
The People can help you.

1094
01:52:47,027 --> 01:52:48,307
I know it.

1095
01:52:50,321 --> 01:52:52,148
Why would they help us?

1096
01:53:08,214 --> 01:53:11,299
The People say Eywa will provide.

1097
01:53:13,261 --> 01:53:15,930
With no home, no hope,

1098
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,179
there was only one place they could go.

1099
01:53:33,615 --> 01:53:34,777
Link's running.

1100
01:53:35,533 --> 01:53:38,487
-What's the plan here, Jake?
-There's no plan.

1101
01:53:39,579 --> 01:53:44,205
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place.

1102
01:53:45,251 --> 01:53:46,580
I gotta try.

1103
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,661
Launching.

1104
01:54:12,195 --> 01:54:13,393
Outcast.

1105
01:54:14,197 --> 01:54:15,395
Betrayer.

1106
01:54:16,532 --> 01:54:17,647
Alien.

1107
01:54:19,243 --> 01:54:21,913
I was in the place the eye does not see.

1108
01:54:33,132 --> 01:54:36,964
I needed their help, and they needed mine.

1109
01:54:37,929 --> 01:54:39,886
But to ever face them again,

1110
01:54:40,014 --> 01:54:42,422
I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level.

1111
01:54:51,025 --> 01:54:54,311
Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move.

1112
01:54:57,115 --> 01:54:59,440
There's something we gotta do.

1113
01:54:59,575 --> 01:55:01,235
You're not gonna like it.

1114
01:55:11,295 --> 01:55:15,079
The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

1115
01:55:15,216 --> 01:55:16,794
Nothing attacks him.

1116
01:55:17,343 --> 01:55:18,623
Easy, boy.

1117
01:55:19,136 --> 01:55:20,928
So why would he ever look up?

1118
01:55:22,098 --> 01:55:23,675
But that was just a theory.

1119
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:35,997
Toruk Macto?

1120
01:57:15,836 --> 01:57:17,295
I See you.

1121
01:57:20,424 --> 01:57:21,704
I See you.

1122
01:57:30,059 --> 01:57:31,719
I was afraid, Jake.

1123
01:57:33,187 --> 01:57:34,646
For my people.

1124
01:57:37,733 --> 01:57:39,311
I'm not anymore.

1125
01:57:48,827 --> 01:57:51,069
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

1126
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:53,704
I stand before you...

1127
01:57:54,833 --> 01:57:57,870
ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1128
01:58:00,547 --> 01:58:04,759
You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior.

1129
01:58:05,969 --> 01:58:08,092
I can't do this without you.

1130
01:58:15,187 --> 01:58:16,562
Toruk Macto,

1131
01:58:24,446 --> 01:58:26,154
I will fly with you.

1132
01:58:29,493 --> 01:58:31,201
My friend is dying.

1133
01:58:33,622 --> 01:58:35,116
Grace is dying.

1134
01:58:37,167 --> 01:58:38,994
I beg the help of Eywa.

1135
01:58:50,931 --> 01:58:52,888
Look where we are, Grace.

1136
01:58:59,648 --> 01:59:01,973
I need to take some samples.

1137
01:59:25,465 --> 01:59:29,510
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1138
01:59:30,762 --> 01:59:32,173
in this body.

1139
01:59:34,766 --> 01:59:36,391
Is that possible?

1140
01:59:36,518 --> 01:59:40,979
She must pass through the eye of Eywa
and return.

1141
01:59:42,274 --> 01:59:43,768
But, Jakesully,

1142
01:59:44,818 --> 01:59:46,396
she is very weak.

1143
01:59:47,904 --> 01:59:50,692
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1144
01:59:53,994 --> 01:59:56,532
Hear us please, All Mother.

1145
01:59:57,164 --> 01:59:59,370
Eywa, help her.

1146
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:02,290
Take this spirit into you...

1147
02:00:05,964 --> 02:00:08,040
and breathe her back to us.

1148
02:00:11,970 --> 02:00:13,548
Let her walk among us...

1149
02:00:16,141 --> 02:00:18,015
as one of The People.

1150
02:00:46,963 --> 02:00:47,994
Jake.

1151
02:00:50,467 --> 02:00:51,581
Grace.

1152
02:00:53,762 --> 02:00:55,422
I'm with her, Jake.

1153
02:00:57,474 --> 02:00:58,802
She's real!

1154
02:01:01,895 --> 02:01:05,015
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1155
02:01:06,232 --> 02:01:07,810
What's happening?

1156
02:01:08,818 --> 02:01:10,443
What's happening?

1157
02:01:14,824 --> 02:01:15,939
Grace!

1158
02:01:16,701 --> 02:01:17,816
Grace!

1159
02:01:19,954 --> 02:01:21,532
What's happening?

1160
02:01:27,837 --> 02:01:29,213
Did it work?

1161
02:01:34,928 --> 02:01:38,972
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

1162
02:01:40,683 --> 02:01:42,391
She is with Eywa now.

1163
02:02:16,219 --> 02:02:18,840
With your permission, I will speak now.

1164
02:02:21,266 --> 02:02:23,673
You would honor me by translating.

1165
02:02:30,817 --> 02:02:32,975
The Sky People have sent us a message

1166
02:02:36,406 --> 02:02:38,778
that they can take whatever they want

1167
02:02:40,618 --> 02:02:42,362
and no one can stop them.

1168
02:02:45,999 --> 02:02:47,742
Well, we will send them a message.

1169
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:52,708
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

1170
02:02:56,050 --> 02:02:58,376
You tell the other clans to come.

1171
02:03:01,556 --> 02:03:04,011
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

1172
02:03:06,269 --> 02:03:09,020
And you fly now with me!

1173
02:03:10,106 --> 02:03:12,562
My brothers! Sisters!

1174
02:03:13,693 --> 02:03:15,732
And we will show the Sky People

1175
02:03:16,779 --> 02:03:18,606
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1176
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:21,568
and that this,

1177
02:03:22,326 --> 02:03:23,322
this is our land!

1178
02:03:30,460 --> 02:03:31,870
Yah!

1179
02:03:47,018 --> 02:03:48,393
Yah!

1180
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,169
Yah!

1181
02:04:36,734 --> 02:04:38,193
We rode out to the 4 winds.

1182
02:04:40,988 --> 02:04:43,360
To the horse clans of the plain.

1183
02:04:46,369 --> 02:04:47,364
Back to the stars!

1184
02:04:47,495 --> 02:04:49,653
To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea.

1185
02:04:49,789 --> 02:04:50,987
For our children's children!

1186
02:04:51,123 --> 02:04:53,661
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

1187
02:04:57,546 --> 02:04:58,875
Yah!

1188
02:05:35,084 --> 02:05:37,539
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1189
02:05:37,670 --> 02:05:39,461
is fighting for survival.

1190
02:05:39,588 --> 02:05:41,047
That's a fact!

1191
02:05:41,924 --> 02:05:45,625
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

1192
02:05:46,762 --> 02:05:50,594
Now, these orbital images tell me

1193
02:05:51,058 --> 02:05:54,225
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1194
02:05:54,353 --> 02:05:56,844
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1195
02:05:57,439 --> 02:05:59,397
And more are pouring in.

1196
02:06:01,902 --> 02:06:05,271
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

1197
02:06:05,406 --> 02:06:07,694
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

1198
02:06:07,825 --> 02:06:09,983
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1199
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:15,203
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

1200
02:06:15,332 --> 02:06:17,657
We will fight terror with terror.

1201
02:06:22,006 --> 02:06:26,134
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1202
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:28,585
is protected by their...

1203
02:06:28,721 --> 02:06:30,049
Their deity.

1204
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:33,429
And when we destroy it,

1205
02:06:33,559 --> 02:06:35,847
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

1206
02:06:35,978 --> 02:06:39,429
that they won't come within
1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1207
02:06:39,565 --> 02:06:42,234
And that, too, is a fact.

1208
02:06:42,985 --> 02:06:44,693
Yeah! Yeah.

1209
02:06:55,205 --> 02:06:59,120
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

1210
02:06:59,251 --> 02:07:01,457
They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives.

1211
02:07:01,587 --> 02:07:04,457
It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign.

1212
02:07:04,590 --> 02:07:06,463
Fricking daisy cutters!

1213
02:07:08,010 --> 02:07:10,797
Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

1214
02:07:10,929 --> 02:07:12,969
-When?
-0600 tomorrow.

1215
02:07:13,098 --> 02:07:14,925
-Max! Max!
-I gotta go.

1216
02:07:16,852 --> 02:07:18,311
We're screwed!

1217
02:07:19,813 --> 02:07:21,972
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

1218
02:07:22,107 --> 02:07:24,266
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1219
02:07:25,777 --> 02:07:29,111
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1220
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:34,151
I have 15 clans out there.

1221
02:07:34,870 --> 02:07:36,946
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1222
02:07:38,498 --> 02:07:42,911
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1223
02:07:44,004 --> 02:07:48,002
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

1224
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,009
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1225
02:07:50,135 --> 02:07:54,347
If they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

1226
02:07:56,266 --> 02:07:59,682
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

1227
02:07:59,811 --> 02:08:00,974
Yeah, I know.

1228
02:08:01,104 --> 02:08:03,560
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1229
02:08:03,690 --> 02:08:06,857
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

1230
02:08:07,694 --> 02:08:09,651
It'll destroy them.

1231
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:12,152
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1232
02:08:27,255 --> 02:08:30,209
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1233
02:08:32,678 --> 02:08:37,386
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

1234
02:08:39,976 --> 02:08:44,354
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

1235
02:08:45,649 --> 02:08:47,725
See the world we come from.

1236
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:50,734
There's no green there.

1237
02:08:52,155 --> 02:08:54,112
They killed their Mother.

1238
02:08:54,950 --> 02:08:57,405
And they're gonna do the same here.

1239
02:08:59,079 --> 02:09:01,617
More Sky People are gonna come.

1240
02:09:01,748 --> 02:09:04,749
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1241
02:09:06,086 --> 02:09:07,794
Unless we stop them.

1242
02:09:10,423 --> 02:09:13,460
Look, you chose me for something.

1243
02:09:14,970 --> 02:09:16,796
I will stand and fight.

1244
02:09:17,889 --> 02:09:19,431
You know I will.

1245
02:09:21,977 --> 02:09:24,183
But I need a little help here.

1246
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:33,361
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1247
02:09:35,198 --> 02:09:38,614
She protects only the balance of life.

1248
02:09:50,463 --> 02:09:52,123
It was worth a try.

1249
02:10:22,871 --> 02:10:24,828
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1250
02:10:24,956 --> 02:10:28,242
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1251
02:10:40,388 --> 02:10:43,722
This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex.

1252
02:10:44,142 --> 02:10:47,677
-Switch to manual flight mode.
-Copy. Manual flight mode.

1253
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:24,465
This is Papa Dragon.

1254
02:11:24,599 --> 02:11:27,635
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1255
02:11:35,193 --> 02:11:38,893
-Suit Team, go.
-All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

1256
02:11:49,499 --> 02:11:51,076
Move, move, move!

1257
02:11:56,756 --> 02:11:58,499
Bravo 1-1, move left.

1258
02:11:59,092 --> 02:12:01,178
Bravo 1-1 moving left.

1259
02:12:01,803 --> 02:12:03,086
Watch flank.

1260
02:12:04,847 --> 02:12:08,382
-Watch formation. Keep moving.
-Roger that.

1261
02:12:08,518 --> 02:12:10,843
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.

1262
02:12:10,978 --> 02:12:12,259
Copy that. Over.

1263
02:12:12,397 --> 02:12:17,023
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

1264
02:12:17,652 --> 02:12:20,937
All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target.

1265
02:12:21,072 --> 02:12:23,444
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

1266
02:12:28,579 --> 02:12:31,070
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1267
02:12:32,083 --> 02:12:34,656
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.

1268
02:12:34,836 --> 02:12:37,706
Make no mistake, people,
they're out there.

1269
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:42,543
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, 4 klicks.

1270
02:12:42,677 --> 02:12:44,835
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1271
02:12:45,012 --> 02:12:47,468
-Copy. Prepare to offload.
-Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1272
02:12:48,307 --> 02:12:50,466
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1273
02:12:52,770 --> 02:12:53,801
Hold!

1274
02:13:01,862 --> 02:13:03,855
Charlie 2-1, got big movement.

1275
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:05,365
-Hold position.
-Hold up, hold up.

1276
02:13:05,491 --> 02:13:09,619
-We got movement out there, 500 meters.
-Charlie 2-1, hold position.

1277
02:13:15,751 --> 02:13:18,669
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

1278
02:13:18,796 --> 02:13:21,287
-Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
-Firing line!

1279
02:13:21,716 --> 02:13:24,385
Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.

1280
02:13:25,136 --> 02:13:27,840
-Can't you clean it up?
-No, sir. It's the Flux.

1281
02:13:56,167 --> 02:13:58,788
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

1282
02:14:40,586 --> 02:14:43,291
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1283
02:14:44,465 --> 02:14:45,627
Break right. Come around.

1284
02:14:49,220 --> 02:14:50,678
Light them up!

1285
02:14:58,354 --> 02:15:00,512
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1286
02:15:07,821 --> 02:15:09,648
Yeah! Get some!

1287
02:15:48,695 --> 02:15:50,487
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1288
02:16:01,375 --> 02:16:03,118
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1289
02:16:03,836 --> 02:16:06,505
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1290
02:16:06,630 --> 02:16:07,626
Copy. Get out of there.

1291
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:14,095
That's him. Get after him!

1292
02:16:31,071 --> 02:16:32,530
Take him out!

1293
02:16:40,872 --> 02:16:42,283
Light her up!

1294
02:16:51,341 --> 02:16:52,717
Right there!

1295
02:16:52,884 --> 02:16:55,091
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

1296
02:16:55,387 --> 02:16:57,011
-Keep her in your sights.
-Purging. Feeding the leak.

1297
02:16:57,139 --> 02:16:58,134
Arming all pods.

1298
02:17:03,895 --> 02:17:04,927
That's it!

1299
02:17:35,635 --> 02:17:36,715
Seze!

1300
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:42,859
Rogue 1 is hit. I'm going in.

1301
02:18:43,787 --> 02:18:45,162
Sorry, Jake.

1302
02:18:54,047 --> 02:18:55,078
Fire.

1303
02:19:13,233 --> 02:19:15,688
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1304
02:19:18,571 --> 02:19:20,196
Rogue 1, you copy?

1305
02:19:22,242 --> 02:19:23,356
Trudy!

1306
02:19:34,295 --> 02:19:35,540
Time to target, 2 minutes.

1307
02:19:35,922 --> 02:19:38,294
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1308
02:19:38,424 --> 02:19:40,547
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

1309
02:19:46,432 --> 02:19:50,216
-Arm number 1!
-Number 1 armed!

1310
02:19:51,688 --> 02:19:52,850
Ma Jake!

1311
02:19:54,816 --> 02:19:55,930
I read you.

1312
02:20:05,118 --> 02:20:07,075
-Neytiri!
-Seze's dead.

1313
02:20:07,704 --> 02:20:10,159
They are very close. They are many.

1314
02:20:11,624 --> 02:20:13,083
Do not attack.

1315
02:20:13,710 --> 02:20:15,619
Do you read me, Neytiri?

1316
02:20:18,256 --> 02:20:19,501
Do not attack!

1317
02:20:19,882 --> 02:20:23,002
Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!

1318
02:20:31,144 --> 02:20:32,306
Neytiri!

1319
02:20:34,439 --> 02:20:36,312
I got movement, I got movement.

1320
02:20:36,441 --> 02:20:38,647
Hold position. Something's coming.

1321
02:20:38,776 --> 02:20:40,520
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over.

1322
02:20:40,653 --> 02:20:42,776
-We got movement 200 meters.
-Hold your formation.

1323
02:20:42,905 --> 02:20:44,565
-Be ready.
-Watch your flanks.

1324
02:20:49,746 --> 02:20:51,204
Hundred meters and closing fast.

1325
02:21:07,805 --> 02:21:09,762
We gotta get out of here!

1326
02:21:11,309 --> 02:21:12,969
-Fall back! Fall back!
-Move! Move! Move!

1327
02:21:13,102 --> 02:21:15,474
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

1328
02:21:22,653 --> 02:21:25,323
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1329
02:21:32,205 --> 02:21:33,948
Eywa has heard you!

1330
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:45,926
Come on!

1331
02:21:58,231 --> 02:22:00,057
Fall back! Move! Move!

1332
02:22:24,590 --> 02:22:27,164
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1333
02:22:27,301 --> 02:22:31,381
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1334
02:22:31,514 --> 02:22:34,349
-Press to target.
-Copy. Pressing to target.

1335
02:22:34,475 --> 02:22:36,432
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1336
02:22:56,288 --> 02:22:58,696
On my mark.
2, 1, mark.

1337
02:22:58,833 --> 02:23:01,502
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go!

1338
02:23:35,286 --> 02:23:36,400
Brace!

1339
02:23:53,470 --> 02:23:54,751
It's Sully.

1340
02:24:08,527 --> 02:24:10,769
-Mask on!
-Breach alarm!

1341
02:26:47,978 --> 02:26:49,804
Come on. Come to papa.

1342
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:19,084
Give it up, Quaritch!

1343
02:27:22,178 --> 02:27:23,637
It's all over.

1344
02:27:24,931 --> 02:27:27,339
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1345
02:27:27,475 --> 02:27:29,717
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1346
02:28:25,909 --> 02:28:27,071
Come on!

1347
02:28:43,009 --> 02:28:47,054
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

1348
02:28:51,768 --> 02:28:53,891
You think you're one of them?

1349
02:28:55,188 --> 02:28:56,765
Time to wake up.

1350
02:30:41,043 --> 02:30:42,039
Jake?

1351
02:30:55,808 --> 02:30:56,839
Jake.

1352
02:31:14,910 --> 02:31:16,239
Jake.

1353
02:31:32,344 --> 02:31:34,302
Jake! Ma Jake!

1354
02:32:15,971 --> 02:32:17,252
I See you.

1355
02:32:22,978 --> 02:32:24,259
I See you.

1356
02:32:26,565 --> 02:32:32,613
Subtitles: Arigon

1357
02:32:35,908 --> 02:32:38,695
The aliens went back to their dying world.

1358
02:32:40,913 --> 02:32:43,783
Only a few were chosen to stay.

1359
02:32:56,011 --> 02:32:58,467
The time of great sorrow was ending.

1360
02:33:00,599 --> 02:33:02,971
Toruk Macto was no longer needed.

1361
02:33:15,531 --> 02:33:19,398
Well, I guess this is my last video log.

1362
02:33:21,286 --> 02:33:25,035
'Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm...

1363
02:33:26,125 --> 02:33:28,912
I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place.

1364
02:33:32,548 --> 02:33:34,671
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1365
02:33:37,261 --> 02:33:40,297
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party.

1366
02:33:43,684 --> 02:33:46,056
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1367
02:33:48,647 --> 02:33:50,889
This is Jake Sully signing off.
