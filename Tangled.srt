<i>(Flynn narrates)
This is the story of how I died.</i>

4
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:02,361
<i>Don't worry, this is actually
a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.</i>

5 
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,846
<i>This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.</i>

6
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,236
<i>And it starts, with the sun.</i>

7
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:15,592
<i>Now, once upon a time, a single
drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.</i>

8
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:21,194
<i>And from this small drop of sun,
grew a magic, golden, flower.</i>

9
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,450
<i>It had the ability to heal the sick,
and injured.</i>

10
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:28,507
<i>Oh, you see that old woman,
over there?</i>

11
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:30,380
<i>You might want to remember her.</i>

12
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,142
<i>She's kind of important.</i>

13
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:37,713
<i>Well, centuries pass and a hop
skip and a bump right away there grew a kingdom.</i>

14
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:41,014
<i>The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.</i>

15
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,077
<i>And the Queen, well she was about
to have a baby,</i>

16
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:47,515
<i>and she got sick,</i>

17
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:49,281
<i>really, sick.</i>

18
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:50,697
<i>She was running out of time.</i>

19
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:53,151
<i>And that's when people usually start
to look for a miracle.</i>

20
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,642
<i>Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</i>

21
00:01:57,203 --> 00:02:00,148
<i>Ahhh, I told you she'd
be important.</i>

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,419
<i>You see instead of sharing the
suns gift,</i>

23
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,442
<i>this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded it's healing power</i>

24
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:08,299
<i>and used it to keep herself
young for hundreds of years.</i>

25
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,307
<i>And all she had to do,
was sing a special song.</i>

26
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:20,134
<i>*Flower gleam and glow,
let your power shine*</i>

27
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:28,292
<i>*Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine*</i>

<i>*What once was mine*</i>

29
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,873
<i>All right, you get the jist. She sings
she turns young, creepy, right?</i>

30
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,902
We've found it!

31
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:57,850
<i>Flynn: The magic of the golden flower,
healed the queen.</i>

32
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:02,661
<i>A healthy baby girl,
a princess was born.</i>

33
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,725
<i>With beautiful golden hair.</i>

34
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,900
<i>I'll give you a hint.</i>

35
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,646
<i>That's Rapunzel.</i>

36
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:24,071
<i>To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.</i>

37
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:31,710
<i>For that one moment,
everything was perfect.</i>

38
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,402
<i>And then that moment ended.</i>

39
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:47,029
<i>*Flower, gleam and glow,
let your powers shine*</i>

40
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:50,016
<i>*Make the clock re...*
HUH!</i>

41
00:03:56,065 --> 00:04:01,091
<i>Gothel broke into the castle and stole
the child, just like that...gone.</i>

42
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:06,201
<i>The Kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the Princess.</i>

43
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,033
<i>But deep within the forest</i>

44
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:09,544
<i>In a hidden tower.</i>

45
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:11,427
<i>Gothel raised the child
as her own.</i>

46
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:21,177
<i>*...bring back what was lost,  what once
was mine, what once was mine.*</i>

47
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,178
<i>Gothel had found her new magic flower.</i>

48
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,462
<i>But this time she was determined
to keep it hidden.</i>

49
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:29,228
Why can't I go outside?

50
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,244
The outside world is a dangerous place.

51
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:34,558
Filled with horrible, selfish people.

52
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:40,462
-You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
-Yes, Mommy.

53
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,684
<i>Flynn: But the walls of that tower,
could not hide everything.</i>

54
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,278
<i>Each year on her birthday, the King
and Queen released thousands of lanterns
into the sky.</i>

55
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,957
<i>In hope that one day, their lost
Princess, would return.</i>

56
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,475
HAH!

57
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:27,452
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's
not hiding out here.

58

59

GOTCHA!

60
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:35,128
That's twenty two for me.

61
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,706
How about twenty three,
out of forty five?

62
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:41,077
Okay, well, what do you want to do?

63
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,808
Yeah, I don't think so.

64
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,616
I like it in here and so do you.

65
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:53,933
Oh, come on Pascal, it's
not so bad in there.

Wow!

89
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:37,029
I could get used to a view like this.

90
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,452
-Flynn, come on.
-Hold on.

91
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:43,954
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.

92
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:47,468
We do this job, you could
buy your own castle.

Oh, hay fever?

Yeah.

96
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,155
Huh?

97
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,444
Wait, wait.
Hey, wait!

98
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:10,659
Can't you picture me in a castle of
my own?

99
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,726
I mean, I certainly can.

100

Oh, the things we've seen and
it's only eight in the morning.

Gentlemen, this is a very big day.

a very big day, Pascal.

103
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:24,970
(giggles) I'm finally going to do it.

-I'm going to ask her.
-RAPUNZEL!

105

Let down your hair.

106
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:32,427
It's time.

107
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:36,889
I know, I know. Come on, don't
let her see you.

108
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:43,156
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any
younger down here.

109
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,995
Coming, mother.

110
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,310
Hi, welcome home, mother.

111
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:16,978
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do
that every single day,

112
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:20,946
without fail, it looks absolutely
exhausting, darling.

113
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:23,135
Oh, it's nothing.

114
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:25,145
Then I don't know why it
takes so long.

115
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:27,730
(Laughs)
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.

116
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:35,405
All right...so, mother.
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.

117
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,456
Rapunzel look at that mirror.
You know what I see?

118
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:41,816
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

119
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:44,372
Oh look, you're here too.

120
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:48,490
I'm just teasing, stop taking
everything so seriously.

121
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:52,900
Okay, so mother. I was thinking tomorrow...

122
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,351
Flower, mother's feeling a little run down.

123
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,603
Would you sing for me, dear?

124
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:59,230
-Then we'll talk.
-OH! Of course, mother.

125

00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:16,893
-Rapunzel!
-So, mother,

128
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:19,990
Earlier I ask if tomorrow was a
pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,

129
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:22,185
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!

130
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:23,541
TADA!

131
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,651
No, no, no can't be.

132
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,842
I distinctly remember. Your
birthday was last year.

133
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:32,144
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

134
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:36,800
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.

135
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:41,514
And I wanted to ask,
what I really want for this birthday.

136
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:44,510
Actually what I want for every birthday...

137
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,163
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.

138
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,164
You know how I feel about the mumbling.

139
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,225
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.

140
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,725
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.

141
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:01,261
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.

142
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:04,850
-What?
-Oh,...

143
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:08,455
Well I was hoping you would
take me to see the floating lights.

144
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:11,660
Oh, you mean the stars.

145
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:13,413
That's the thing

146
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:17,700
I've charted stars and they're
always constant.

147
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:21,582
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

148
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,582
Only on my birthday.

149

And I can't help but feel that they're,

150
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:28,352
They're meant for me.

151
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:32,998
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.

152
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,472
In person.

153
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:37,300
I have to know what they are.

154
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,503
You want to go outside?

155
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,694
Oh, why Rapunzel.

156
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,988
Look at you, as
fragile as a flower.

157
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:48,784
<i>*Still a little sapling, just a sprout.*</i>

158
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:53,081
<i>-*You know why we stay up in this tower*
-I know, but...</i>

159
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:57,835
<i>*That’s right, to keep you safe,
and sound, dear.*</i>

160
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,607
<i>*Guess I always knew this day was coming.*</i>

161
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:04,479
<i>*Know that soon you'd want
to leave the nest.*</i>

162
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,826
<i>-*Soon, but not yet. Shhh..*
-But</i>

Mother, knows best.*</i>

166
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:20,539

out there.*</i>

167
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,422
<i>*Mother knows best.*</i>

168
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:27,203

will go wrong, I swear.*</i>

169

quicksand.*</i>

<i>*Cannibals, and snakes,
the plague.*</i>

171
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:36,305
<i>*Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth.*</i>

172
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:40,124
<i>*And stop, no more,
you'll just upset me.*</i>

173
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,742

mother will protect you.*</i>

<i>*Darling here's what I suggest.*</i>

175
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:49,610
<i>*Skip the drama,

<i>*Mother knows best.
Take it from your mumsey.*</i>

<i>*On your own, you won't survive.*</i>

179

<i>*Please, they'll eat you up,
alive.*</i>

<i>*All I have is one request.*</i>

187
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,569
-Rapunzel?
-Yes?

188
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,711
Don't ever ask to
leave this tower, again.

189
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:45,187
Yes, Mother.

190
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:49,276
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.

191
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:51,341
I love you more.

192
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:54,077
I love you most.

193
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:57,007
Don't forget it.

194
00:14:57,008 --> 00:15:00,984
<i>*You'll regret it.*</i>

00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:05,334
<i>*Knows best.*</i>

197
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:12,818
Rapunzel, I'll see you
in a bit, my flower.

198
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:15,894
I'll be here.

199
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:44,935
No, no no. This is bad, this is
very, very bad, This is really bad.

200
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:48,349
They just can't get my nose right.

201
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,997
Who cares.

202
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,511
Well it's easy for you to say.

203
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:53,588
You guys look amazing.

204
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:11,456
All right, okay. Give me a boost,
and I'll pull you up.

205
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,232
Give us the satchel first.

206
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,770
Wha..? I just...

207
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:18,577
I can't believe, that after all
we've been together,

208
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,991
you don't trust me.

209
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,129
Ouch.

210
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:34,276
Now help us up, pretty boy.

211
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:37,095
Sorry, my hands are full.

212
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,765
What?

213
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:41,588
RYDER!

214
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:49,889
Retrieve that satchel with any force.

215
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,441
We got him now, Maximus.

216
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:17,380
Go!

217
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,199
Heyah! Come flea-bag, forward.

218
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:27,780
No.

219
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,550
No, stop it.

220
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,540
HAH!

221
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,913
-AHHHHH!
-WHINNEYY!

222
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:24,602
(Sniffing)

223
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,240
(Horse whinnies in distance)

224
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:15,745
Alone at last.

225
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:16,908
(((CLANG!!!)))

226
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:17,279
Huh?

227
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,061
(((CLANG!!)))

228
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:52,188
Okay, okay, I got a person
in the closet.

229
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:55,309
I got a person in the closet.

230
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,391
I got a person in my closet!

231
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:05,581
To weak to handle myself
out there, huh Mother?

232
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:09,965
Well, Tell that to my pan here.

233
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:51,714
Rapunzel!

234
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:55,556
Let down your hair.

235
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:57,197
One moment, Mother.

236
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:59,348
I have a big surprise.

237
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,582
Uh, I do too.

238
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,217
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.

239
00:22:04,218 --> 00:22:06,641
I don't think you got it.

240
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:12,472
I found my parsnips. I can always make
hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.

241
00:22:12,473 --> 00:22:13,672
Surprise!

242
00:22:13,673 --> 00:22:16,313
Well mother, there's something
I want to tell you.

243
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:18,950
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

244
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:21,569
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

245
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,315
Okay, I've been thinking a lot
about what you said, earlier.

246
00:22:24,316 --> 00:22:26,632
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

247
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:29,215
Before you answer, yes
I'm leading up to that.

248
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:31,479
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

249
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,422
No Mother, I'm just saying,

250
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:36,250
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

251
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:39,662
Oh darling, I know you're not strong
enough to handle yourself out there.

252
00:22:39,663 --> 00:22:42,863
-But if you just...
-Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.

253
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,102
-But trust me, I...
-Rapunzel.

254
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:45,465
-...know what I'm
-Rapunzel.

255
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:47,622
-Oh, come on.
-You have no other life, Rapunzel.

256
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:52,084
You are not leaving this tower,
EVER!

257
00:22:57,601 --> 00:23:01,394
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.

258
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:17,063
All I was gonna say, mother
is that...

259
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:20,308
I know what I want for my
birthday, now.

260
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:22,022
And what is that?

261
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:28,276
New paint. That paint made from
the white shells you once brought me.

262
00:23:28,277 --> 00:23:31,338
Well that is a very long trip,
Rapunzel.

263
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:33,187
Almost three day's time.

264
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:38,156
I just thought it was a
better idea than, stars.

265
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:44,893
You sure you'll be all right,
on your own?

266
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:48,187
I know I'm safe, as long
as I'm here.

267
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:58,693
I'll be back in three days time.

268
00:23:58,694 --> 00:24:01,943
I love you very much, dear.

269
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,864
I love you more.

270
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:07,348
I love you most.

271
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:28,832
Okay.

272
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,719
AHH!

273
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Wha..?

274
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:16,624
Is this...hair?

275
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:20,177
Struggling...struggling is pointless.

276
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:25,238
I know why you're here.

277
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,914
And I'm not afraid of you.

278
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,400
What?

279
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:41,752
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

280
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:44,519
Ah hah.

281
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,137
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

282
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,031
(Clears throat)

283
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:53,852
I know not who you are.

284
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,979
Nor how I came to find you.

285
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,886
But may I just say.

286
00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:00,695
Hi!

287
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:04,647
How you doing?

288
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:06,127
The names Flynn Ryder.

289
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,937
How's it going, huh?

290
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,742
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?

291
00:26:14,743 --> 00:26:16,261
-All right, Blondie.
-Rapunzel.

292
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,372
Gesundheit, here's the thing.

293
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:21,116
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.

294
00:26:21,197 --> 00:26:23,231
I can across your tower and...

295
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:26,533
Ho, ho no, where is my satchel?

296
00:26:26,534 --> 00:26:30,013
I hid it, somewhere you'll
never find it.

297
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:34,516
It's in the pot, isn't it.

298
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:36,181
(((Clang!!)))

299
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:43,286
Ahh, would you stop that.

300
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:45,969
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.

301
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:50,217
So, what do you want,
with my hair?

302
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:51,432
-To cut it?
-What?

303
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:53,063
-Sell it?
-No!

304
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:55,931
Listen, the only thing I want
to do with your hair,

305
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:58,661
is to get out of it.
Literally.

306
00:26:58,995 --> 00:27:02,075
Wait, you don't want my hair?

307
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:04,017
Why on earth would
I want your hair?

308
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:07,442
Look, I was being chased, I saw a
tower, I climbed it, end of story.

309
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:09,422
You're, telling the truth?

310
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:10,850
YES!

311
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:11,945
Hmmm.

312
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,174
I know, but he's someone
 that can take me.

313
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,520
I think he's telling the truth.

314
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,334
Nothing I think,
but what choice do I have?

315
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:37,410
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

316
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:39,049
-Deal?
-Look this way.

317
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:43,130
Do you know what these are?

318
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:46,372
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

319
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,217
Lanterns...

320
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:50,320
I knew they weren't stars.

321
00:27:51,113 --> 00:27:55,706
Well, tomorrow evening
they will light the night sky,

322
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:59,674
with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,

323
00:27:59,675 --> 00:28:03,220
Take me to these lanterns,
and return me home safely.

324
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:07,424
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.

325
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:08,600
That is my deal.

326
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:12,241
Yeah, no can do.

327
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:16,019
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I
are not exactly, simpatico,

328
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,270
at the moment. So I
won't be taking you anywhere.

329
00:28:25,264 --> 00:28:28,298
Something brought you here,
Flynn Ryder.

330
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:32,419
-Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
-A horse.

331
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,978
So I have made the decision to
trust you.

332
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,283
A horrible decision, really.

333
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:38,617
But trust me, when I tell you this.

334
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:44,615
You can tear this tower apart,
brick by brick.

335
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:48,950
but without my help, you will
never find your precious satchel.

336
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:51,870
(Clears throat)
Let me just get this straight.

337
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:53,724
I take you to see the lanterns.

338
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:55,002
Bring you back home.

339
00:28:55,003 --> 00:28:57,134
and you'll give me back my satchel?

340
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,369
I promise.

341
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,026
And when I promise something, I never
ever break that promise.

342
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:08,798
EVER!

343
00:29:11,824 --> 00:29:14,523
All right, listen, I didn't want
to have to want to do this,

344
00:29:14,524 --> 00:29:16,086
but you leave me no choice.

345
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:18,458
Here comes the 'smolder'.

346
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,843
This is kind of an off day for me.

347
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:29,600
This doesn't normally happen.

348
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,142
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.

349
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:33,616
Really!

350
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,968
-Ooops.
-You broke my 'smolder'.

351
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,832
You coming, Blondie?

352
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:57,928
<i>*Look at the world so close, and I'm
half way to it*</i>

353
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:02,965
<i>*Look at it all, so big
do I even dare?*</i>

354
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,756
<i>*I just have to do it.*</i>

355
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,764
Should I? No.

356
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,455
Here I go.

357
00:30:41,195 --> 00:30:47,078
<i>*Just smell the grass, the dirt.
Just like I dreamed they'd be.*</i>

358
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,235
<i>*Just feel that summer breeze.*</i>

359
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:53,385
<i>*The way it's calling me.*</i>

360
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:59,472
<i>*For like the first time ever,
I'm completely free.*</i>

361
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:06,342
<i>*I could go running, and racing,
and dancing...</i>

362
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:09,170
<i>*and chasing, and leaping
and bounding.*</i>

363
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:12,710
<i>*hair flying, heart pounding
and splashing and reeling.*</i>

364
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:15,710
<i>*And finally feeling,*</i>

365
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:25,891
<i>*Now's when my life
begins.*</i>

366
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:32,491
I can't believe I did this.

367
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:37,427
(Mumbles) I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!

368
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:40,627
Mother will be so furious.

369
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:44,550
That's okay, what she doesn’t
know won't kill her, right?

370
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:47,310
Oh my gosh, this will kill her.

371
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:50,590
THIS IS SO FUN!

372
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:54,170
I am a horrible person,
I'm going back.

373
00:31:54,171 --> 00:31:56,774
I am never going
baaaccckkk!

374
00:31:56,775 --> 00:32:00,695
I am a despicable human being.

375
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:02,719
WAHHOOOOO!

376
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,279
Best day, ever!

377
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,825
(Sobbing)

378
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:13,054
(Clears throat)

379
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:16,700
You know, I can't help but notice,

380
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,931
you seem a little at war
with yourself, here.

381
00:32:20,412 --> 00:32:23,322
-Really?
-The whole day,
Bits and pieces.

382
00:32:23,323 --> 00:32:25,692
Sort of protective mother,
forbidden road trip.

383
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,248
This is serious stuff.

384
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:29,129
But let me ease your conscious.

385
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,831
This is part of growing up.

386
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:32,912
A little rebellion, a little adventure.

387
00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:34,816
That's good, healthy even.

388
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:37,759
(Laughs) You think?

389
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,685
I know. You're way over thinking
your stress meter.

390
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:42,064
Did your mother deserve it?

391
00:32:42,814 --> 00:32:45,270
Will this break her heart
and crush her soul?

392
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:48,219
Well of course.
But you just got to do it.

393
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,582
Break her heart?

394
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,723
-It can.
-Crush her soul?

395
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:55,589
Like a grape.

396
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,331
She would be heart broken,
you're right.

397
00:32:58,536 --> 00:33:02,173
Likely, all right, oh no.

398
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:05,709
All right, I can't believe I'm
saying this, but...

399
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,326
I'm letting you out of the deal.

400
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:09,122
-Well...
-That's right.

401
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:11,670
But don't make me. Let's
just turn around,

402
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:13,391
and you go home, and your frog.

403
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,116
I get back my satchel.

404
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:17,182
You get back a mother
daughter relationship.

405
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:19,136
based on mutual trust and
viola!

406
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:21,283
We part ways as unlikely friends.

407
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:25,680
-No, I am seeing those lanterns.
-Oh, come on!

408
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:27,525
What is it going to take
to get my satchel back?

409
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:29,565
I will use this.

410
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:35,959
What is it, ruffians, thugs?

411
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,767
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.

412
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:45,416
Oh, sorry.

413
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:48,420
Getting just a little bit, jumpy.

414
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:53,270
Probably be best if we avoid
ruffians and thugs, though.

415
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,663
Yeah, that's probably best.

416
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,575
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.

417
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,861
-Where?
-Oh, don't you worry.

418
00:34:03,862 --> 00:34:05,354
You'll know it when you smell it.

419
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,086
(Sniffing)

420
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:44,828
Oh, a Palace horse.

421
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,077
Where's your rider?

422
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,125
Rapunzel.

423
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:51,438
RAPUNZEL!

424
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:02,785
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

425
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:06,186
Rapunzel?

426
00:35:26,262 --> 00:35:27,262
Oh no!

427
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,990
RAPUNZEL!

428
00:36:14,723 --> 00:36:17,917
I know it's around here, somewhere.

429
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:20,546
Ah, there it is.

430
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:22,435
The Snuggly duckling.

431
00:36:22,436 --> 00:36:25,136
Don't worry, very quaint place,
perfect for you.

432
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:28,482
Don't want you scaring, and giving
up on this endeavor now do we?

433
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:31,823
-Well, I do like duckling.
-YAY!

434
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:36,021
Garcon, your finest table, please.

435
00:36:42,437 --> 00:36:45,583
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.

436
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:47,483
Really, it's pretty bad.

437
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:50,445
What are you getting?
Because to me, it's part bad smell.

438
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:52,295
and the other part is
really bad when it smells.

439
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,687
I don't know why, but overall,
it smells like the color brown.

440
00:36:54,688 --> 00:36:55,687
You're in luck.

441
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:58,314
That's a lot of hair.

442
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:01,219
She's growing it out, is that blood
on your moustache?

443
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,769
Goldie, look at this, look at
all the blood on his moustache.

444
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,187
Look, I'm sure that’s a lot of blood.

445
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:08,996
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.

446
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:11,329
Maybe we should get you home.
Call it a day.

447
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,482
Probably better off. This is a five
star joint after all.

448
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:17,889
And if you can't handle this place, well
maybe you should be back in your tower.

449
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:20,532
Is this you?

450
00:37:22,696 --> 00:37:25,436
No, no this is being mean.

451
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:26,666
Oh, it's him all right.

452
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,836
Gretta, go find some guards.

453
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:32,936
That reward is going to
buy me a new hook.

454
00:37:32,937 --> 00:37:34,355
I can use the money.

455
00:37:34,356 --> 00:37:36,349
What about me?
I'm broke.

456
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:40,203
-Boys, stop!
-We can work this out.

457
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:42,267
Hey, leave him alone.

458
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,651
-Please.
-Give me back my guide.

459
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:56,118
Not the nose, not the nose,
not the nose!

460
00:37:58,663 --> 00:38:00,027
Put him down!

461
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:07,610
Okay, I don't know where I am,
and I need him to take me to see the lanterns,

462
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:09,886
because I've been dreaming about
them my entire life.

463
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:12,540
Find your humanity.

464
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,605
Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?

465
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,755
I, had a dream.

466
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:29,834
Once.

467
00:38:38,072 --> 00:38:40,407
<i>*I'm malicious mean and scary.*</i>

468
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:42,833
<i>*My sneer could curdle dairy.*</i>

469
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:46,077
<i>*And violence-wise my hands
are not the cleanest.*</i>

470
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:50,636
<i>*But despite my evil look,
and my temper and my hook.*</i>

471
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,084
<i>*I've always yearned to
be a concert pianist.*</i>

472
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:57,767
<i>*Can't cha see me on the stage
performing Mozart.*</i>

473
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,337
<i>*Tickling the ivories,
'til they gleam.*</i>

474
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:03,565
<i>*Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.*</i>

475
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:06,513
<i>*For my killer show-tune medley.
Thank you.*</i>

476
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:10,185
<i>*'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream.*</i>

477
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:13,468
<i>*He's got a dream,
he's got a dream.*</i>

478
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:16,913
<i>*See, I ain't as cruel and
vicious as I seem.*</i>

479
00:39:16,914 --> 00:39:19,500
<i>*Though I feel like breaking femurs.*</i>

480
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:21,551
<i>*You can count me with the dreamers.*</i>

481
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:24,144
<i>*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*</i>

482
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,569
<i>*I've got scars and lumps and bruises.*</i>

483
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,745
<i>*Plus there's something here that oozes.*</i>

484
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,375
<i>*Let's not even mention
my complexion.*</i>

485
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:38,489
<i>*But despite my extra toes.*</i>

486
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,361
<i>*And my goiter and my nose.*</i>

487
00:39:40,362 --> 00:39:43,410
<i>*I really want to make a love
connection.*</i>

488
00:39:43,411 --> 00:39:47,368
<i>*Can't you see me with a special
little lady.*</i>

489
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:50,573
<i>*Rowing in a row boat,
down the stream.*</i>

490
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:52,576
<i>*Though I'm one disgusting blighter.*</i>

491
00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:54,578
<i>*I'm a lover, not a fighter.*</i>

492
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:57,577
<i>*'Cause way down deep
inside, I gotta dream.*</i>

493
00:39:57,578 --> 00:40:01,180
<i>*I gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*</i>

494
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:04,594
<i>*And I know one day
will never reign supreme.*</i>

495
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:06,744
<i>*Though my face leaves
people screaming.*</i>

496
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:08,816
<i>*There's a child behind
it dreaming.*</i>

497
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:11,481
<i>*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*</i>

498
00:40:11,482 --> 00:40:14,995
<i>*Tor would like to quit
and be a florist.*</i>

499
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:18,926
<i>*Gunther does interior design.*</i>

500
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:22,769
<i>*Ulf is into mime,
Attila’s cupcakes are sublime.*</i>

501
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,562
<i>*Bruiser knits, Killer sews.*</i>

502
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:26,502
<i>*Fang does little puppet shows.*</i>

503
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:31,931
<i>*And Vladimir collects
ceramic unicorns.*</i>

504
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,421
What about you?

505
00:40:34,422 --> 00:40:36,714
-I'm sorry me?
-What's your dream?

506
00:40:36,715 --> 00:40:40,020
No, no, no. Sorry boys,
I don't sing.

507
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:43,000
<i>*I have dreams like you,
no really.*</i>

508
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:44,558
<i>*Just much less, touchy-feely.*</i>

509
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,418
<i>*They mainly happen somewhere
warm and sunny.*</i>

510
00:40:47,419 --> 00:40:51,487
<i>*On an island that I own,
tanned and rested and alone.*</i>

511
00:40:52,194 --> 00:40:55,318
<i>*Surrounded by enormous
piles of money.*</i>

512
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,951
<i>*-I had a dream...I had a dream.
-(Thugs) She’s got a dream.*</i>

513
00:40:58,952 --> 00:41:02,405
<i>*I just want to see the floating
lanterns gleam.*</i>

514
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:04,795
<i>*And with every passing hour.*</i>

515
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,443
<i>*I'm so glad I left my tower.*</i>

516
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:09,287
<i>*Like all you lovely folks,
I've got a dream.*</i>

517
00:41:09,288 --> 00:41:13,298
<i>*She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream.
They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.*</i>

518
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:21,164
<i>*So our differences ain't
really that extreme. We're one big team.*</i>

519
00:41:21,165 --> 00:41:24,957
<i>*Call us brutal or sadistic
and grotesquely optimistic.</i>

520
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,839
<i>*'Cause way down deep inside,
we've gotta dream.*</i>

521
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,113
<i>*We gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*</i>

522
00:41:33,392 --> 00:41:37,301
<i>*Yes everybody here has got a...*</i>

523
00:41:37,302 --> 00:41:43,254
<i>*Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.*</i>

524
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,595
Yeah!

525
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,586
I found the guards.

526
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,799
Where's Ryder,
where is he?

527
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,918
I know he's in here somewhere.

528
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,313
Find him, turn the place
upside down!

529
00:42:13,693 --> 00:42:16,439
Go, live your dream.

530
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,759
I will.

531
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,258
Your dream stinks,
I was talking to her.

532
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,878
Thanks for everything.

533
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:30,487
I believe this is the man
you're looking for.

534
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:32,274
You got me.

535
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,700
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.

536
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:40,127
Maximus.

537
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,836
What he's doing?

538
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,393
A passage, come on men,
let's go.

539
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,391
Corman, make sure those
boys don't get away.

540
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,225
Play it safe.

541
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:13,883
We'll go get the crown.

542
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:25,263
I gotta dream,
I got some dream.

543
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:30,145
Hi, ohhh, somebody get me a glass.

544
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:34,300
'Cause I just found me a
tall drink of water.

545
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:37,321
Oh stop it, you big lug.

546
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:40,751
Where's that tunnel lead out?

547
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:41,809
Knife!

548
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:45,639
Well, that got us safe.

549
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,920
Didn't know you had that in you
back there.

550
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,220
I KNOW!

551
00:43:51,221 --> 00:43:53,217
I know...

552
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:59,099
Sooo, Flynn.

553
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,278
Where are you from?

554
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:02,426
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do that story.

555
00:44:02,427 --> 00:44:05,272
However I am becoming very
interested in yours.

556
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:07,704
Now I...I know I'm not suppose
to mention the hair.

557
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:09,486
-Nope.
-Or, the Mother.

558
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:12,280
-Uh, uh.
-Frankly I'm to scared to
ask about the frog.

559
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:13,612
-Chameleon.
-Gila monster.

560
00:44:13,613 --> 00:44:17,496
Here's my question, if you want
to see the lanterns so badly,

561
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:19,812
why haven't you gone before?

562
00:44:20,173 --> 00:44:23,608
Uhh, hey, well...

563
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:28,911
Uh, Flynn...

564
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,857
Flynn!

565
00:44:53,763 --> 00:44:54,936
Who's that?

566
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:56,120
They don't like me.

567
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,506
-Who's that?
-They don't like me either.

568
00:44:59,212 --> 00:45:01,750
-Who's that?
-Lets just assume for the moment,

569
00:45:01,751 --> 00:45:03,240
that everyone here doesn't like me.

570
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,714
Here.

571
00:45:13,693 --> 00:45:15,783
I've waited a long time for this.

572
00:45:24,874 --> 00:45:28,406
Oh mama, I have got to get me
one of these.

573
00:45:29,132 --> 00:45:30,132
HAH!

574
00:45:36,464 --> 00:45:41,141
You should know that this is
the bravest thing I've ever done.

575
00:45:45,718 --> 00:45:47,463
How 'bout two out of three?

576
00:45:48,577 --> 00:45:49,804
Flynn!

577
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,090
Flynn, look out.

578
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:03,835
You should see your faces.
'Cause you look...

579
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:05,495
Ridiculous

580
00:46:12,705 --> 00:46:13,915
Come on, Blondie.

581
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:15,186
Jump.

582
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:46,133
It's no use,
I can't see anything.

583
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:52,729
Hey, there's no point.

584
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,541
It's pitch black down there.

585
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:03,901
This is all my fault.

586
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:08,604
She was right, I never
should have done this.

587
00:48:12,997 --> 00:48:14,310
I'm so...

588
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:17,544
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

589
00:48:24,721 --> 00:48:26,598
Eugene.

590
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:28,880
What?

591
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:31,661
My real name is,
Eugene Fitzherbert.

592
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:35,173
So you might as well know.

593
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:41,516
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing.

594
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:42,558
What?

595
00:48:44,705 --> 00:48:48,750
I have magic hair,
that glows when I sing.

596
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:53,025
<i>*Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.*</i>

597
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:43,775
We made it.

598
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:45,606
Your hair glows.

599
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:48,283
I'm alive.
I'm alive!

600
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:51,065
Never seen that coming.
Her hair actually glows.

601
00:49:51,066 --> 00:49:52,921
-Eugene...
-Why does her hair glow?

602
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:54,217
-Eugene!
-What?

603
00:49:55,336 --> 00:49:57,980
It doesn't just glow.

604
00:50:00,366 --> 00:50:01,968
Why is he smiling at me?

605
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:27,209
I'll kill him.

606
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,907
I'll kill that, Ryder.

607
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:32,338
Better off to kill him.

608
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:34,527
Get back the crown, come on.

609
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,070
Boys.

610
00:50:38,342 --> 00:50:43,044
Perhaps you want to stop acting
like wild dogs chasing their tails,

611
00:50:43,045 --> 00:50:45,114
and think for a moment.

612
00:50:47,149 --> 00:50:49,437
Oh, please there's no
need for that.

613
00:50:54,794 --> 00:50:58,555
Well if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

614
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,435
I was going to offer you something
worth one thousand crowns,

615
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:03,412
would have made you
rich beyond belief.

616
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:05,375
And that wasn't even the best part.

617
00:51:05,376 --> 00:51:06,934
Oh well, C'est la vie.

618
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:09,147
Enjoy  your crown.

619
00:51:10,815 --> 00:51:12,332
What's the best part?

620
00:51:12,788 --> 00:51:17,590
It comes with revenge
for Flynn Ryder.

621
00:51:24,092 --> 00:51:28,756
So you're being strangely cryptic as  you wrap
your magic hair around my injured hand.

622
00:51:28,937 --> 00:51:31,319
-(Grunts in pain)
-Sorry.

623
00:51:32,204 --> 00:51:36,577
Just don't...don't freak out.

00:52:32,665 --> 00:52:34,100
-Ahhh!
-Don't freak out.

634
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:40,390
-(Stifled)Ahhh. I'm not freaking out,
are you freaking out?

635
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:43,793
Oh that's very interesting hair.
In the back of me, why is it possessed?

636
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:44,840
It's..how long has it been doing that?

637
00:52:47,176 --> 00:52:49,284
Forever, I guess.

638
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:53,738
Mother said when I was a baby
people tried to cut it.

639
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:56,090
They wanted to take it for themselves.

640
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,356
But, once it's cut.

641
00:52:58,357 --> 00:53:00,998
It turns brown, and looses it's power.

642
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,258
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

643
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:08,444
That's why Mother never let me...

644
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:16,250
That's why I...I never left the...

645
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,083
You never left that tower.

646
00:53:23,717 --> 00:53:25,992
And you're still gonna go back?

647
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:28,685
No...yes.

648
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:32,367
It's complicated.

649
00:53:43,004 --> 00:53:46,005
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

650
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:49,693
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare
you the sob story of

651
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:52,726
poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's
a little bit ah...

652
00:53:52,727 --> 00:53:54,409
It's a little bit of a downer.

653
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,137
There was this book.

654
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:04,693
A book I used to read every
night to all the younger kids.

655
00:54:04,694 --> 00:54:06,478
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.

656
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:09,229
Swashbuckling rogue,
richest man alive.

657
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:13,141
Not bad with the ladies. I...nothing
to brag about, of course.

658
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:15,615
Was he a thief too?

659
00:54:15,616 --> 00:54:19,188
Ahh, well no.

660
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,672
Actually, he had enough
money to do whatever he wanted to do.

661
00:54:22,673 --> 00:54:24,375
He could go anywhere that
he wanted to go.

662
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,508
And...and, for a kid,
with nothing.

663
00:54:27,509 --> 00:54:29,486
I don't know, I...

664
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:31,924
It just seemed like a better option.

665
00:54:32,692 --> 00:54:35,358
You can't tell anyone,
about this, okay?

666
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,880
It could ruin my whole reputation.

667
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:40,735
Ahh, you wouldn't want that.

668
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:43,458
Oh, the thing about a reputation,
it's all that a man has.

669
00:54:50,636 --> 00:54:53,595
Um, well I should uh...

670
00:54:54,264 --> 00:54:56,981
I, I should get some
more firewood.

671
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:58,583
Hey.

672
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:04,871
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than, Flynn Ryder.

673
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:09,575
Well, then you'd be the first.

674
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:11,526
But, thank you.

675
00:55:20,615 --> 00:55:23,848
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

676
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:25,123
Mother?

677
00:55:25,124 --> 00:55:27,093
Hello, dear.

678
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:29,591
But I...I..., was going to...

679
00:55:29,986 --> 00:55:31,763
How did you find me?

680
00:55:31,764 --> 00:55:33,665
Oh, it was easy really.

681
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:38,066
I just listened to the sound of
complete and utter betrayal,
and followed that.

682
00:55:39,912 --> 00:55:42,075
-Mother...
-We're going home, Rapunzel.

683
00:55:42,076 --> 00:55:44,460
-Now.
-You...You don't understand.

684
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:46,263
I've been on the most incredible journey.

685
00:55:46,264 --> 00:55:48,435
I've seen and learned so much.

686
00:55:49,528 --> 00:55:51,179
I even met someone.

687
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,480
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.

688
00:55:53,481 --> 00:55:55,560
-Come on, Rapunzel.
-Mother, wait.

689
00:55:55,868 --> 00:55:57,073
I think

690
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,495
I think he likes me.

691
00:56:00,496 --> 00:56:03,068
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel,
that's demented.

692
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:06,055
-But mother, I...
-This is why you never should have left.

693
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:10,188
Dear this whole romance that
you've invented,

694
00:56:10,189 --> 00:56:14,876
just proves you're to naive to be here.

695
00:56:14,877 --> 00:56:18,096
Why a kid like you?
Come on now, really.

696
00:56:18,645 --> 00:56:21,323
Look at you, that face,
that ancient dress.

697
00:56:22,156 --> 00:56:25,598
Do be a darling, come with mommy.

698

<i>*Mother...*</i>

699
00:56:27,825 --> 00:56:31,206

-No?

00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,018
No.

701
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:36,005
I see how it is.

<i>*Mother, knows best.*</i>

719
00:57:31,171 --> 00:57:34,827
So, hey uh,
can I ask you something?

720
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:38,996
Is there any chance that I'm going
to get super strength in my hand?

721
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,892
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.

722
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:45,014
Hey, you all right?

723
00:57:45,402 --> 00:57:47,650
Oh, sorry, yes.

724
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:50,824
Just um, lost in thought,
I guess.

725
00:57:53,032 --> 00:57:55,061
I mean because here's the thing.

726
00:57:55,062 --> 00:57:57,063
Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.

727
00:57:57,064 --> 00:57:59,807
Born with it, but superhuman strength?

728
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:02,505
Imagine the possibilities, I'm just...

729
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:13,236
Patience boys. All good things
to those who wait.

730
00:58:27,627 --> 00:58:28,707
Hmm, what?

731
00:58:32,335 --> 00:58:34,736
Well I hope you're
here to apologize.

732
00:58:35,162 --> 00:58:37,881
AHHHH!

733
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,734
No, no put me down.
No, no!

734
00:58:43,268 --> 00:58:45,443
-Release him.
-OW!

735
00:58:53,464 --> 00:58:54,479
Whoa!

736
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

737
00:58:56,243 --> 00:58:58,714
Easy boy, easy,
calm down.

738
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:01,951
Easy boy.

739
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:03,992
Easy.

740
00:59:05,693 --> 00:59:07,393
That's it.

741
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:12,600
Now sit.

742
00:59:13,451 --> 00:59:14,451
Sit.

743
00:59:15,383 --> 00:59:17,260
Good, now drop the boot.

744
00:59:17,265 --> 00:59:18,670
Drop it.

745
00:59:20,438 --> 00:59:23,645
Oh, you are such a good boy.

746
00:59:23,646 --> 00:59:26,089
Yes you are.

747
00:59:27,492 --> 00:59:31,032
You all tired, chasing the bad
man all over the place?

748
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:32,155
Excuse me.

749
00:59:32,156 --> 00:59:35,002
Nobody appreciates
you, do they?

750
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:36,015
Do they?

751
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:38,555
Come one, he's a bad horse.

752
00:59:38,556 --> 00:59:41,014
Aw, he's nothing but
a big sweetheart.

753
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:43,367
Isn't that right?

754
00:59:44,024 --> 00:59:45,124
Maximus.

755
00:59:45,972 --> 00:59:48,050
You've got to be
kidding me.

756
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:53,144
Look, today is kinda the
biggest day of my life.

757
00:59:53,712 --> 00:59:58,096
And I need, I need you
not to get him arrested.

758
00:59:58,323 --> 01:00:00,761
Just for twenty four hours and then,

759
01:00:00,762 --> 01:00:02,982
you can chase each other to
your hearts content.

760
01:00:02,983 --> 01:00:04,016
Okay?

761
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:08,779
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.

762
01:00:27,484 --> 01:00:28,544
(Mouths) WOW

763
01:00:59,513 --> 01:01:01,348
Sorry.

764
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:24,746
Thank you.

765
01:01:40,705 --> 01:01:43,062
It's the lost Princess.

766
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:01,439
Take a bow.

767
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:13,750
Hey Max.

768
01:03:16,969 --> 01:03:19,395
What? I brought them.

769
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,358
Most of them.

770
01:03:25,505 --> 01:03:27,063
Where are we going?

771
01:03:27,065 --> 01:03:29,277
Well, best day of your life.

772
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:31,243
I figured you should have
a decent seat.

773
01:03:48,862 --> 01:03:50,430
You okay?

774
01:03:51,547 --> 01:03:53,053
I'm terrified.

775
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,358
Why?

776
01:03:55,655 --> 01:03:59,895
I've been looking out the
window for eighteen years.

777
01:03:59,896 --> 01:04:04,659
Dreaming about what it would feel
like when those lights rise in the sky.

778
01:04:06,111 --> 01:04:09,764
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

779
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:13,683
It will be.

780
01:04:15,023 --> 01:04:16,965
And what if it is?

781
01:04:18,114 --> 01:04:20,015
What then?

782
01:04:20,016 --> 01:04:21,746
Well that's the good part,
I guess.

783
01:04:22,545 --> 01:04:24,665
You get to go find a new dream.

784
01:05:57,676 --> 01:06:02,159
<i>*All those days
Watching from the windows.*</i>

785
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,953
<i>*All those years
Outside looking in*</i>

786
01:06:06,954 --> 01:06:11,989
<i>*All that time
Never even knowing*</i>

787
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:18,871
<i>*Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here*</i>

788
01:06:18,872 --> 01:06:23,713
<i>*Blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here*</i>

789
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:28,544
<i>*Suddenly I see
Standing here*</i>

790
01:06:28,545 --> 01:06:35,532
<i>*It's oh, so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be*</i>

791
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:44,609
<i>*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted*</i>

792
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:53,423
<i>*And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new*</i>

793
01:06:53,424 --> 01:07:03,245
<i>*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*</i>

794
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:11,389
<i>*All at once
Everything looks different*</i>

795
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:16,195
<i>*Now that I see you*</i>

796
01:07:22,482 --> 01:07:24,118
I have something for you, too.

797
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:28,309
I should have given it to you
before, but I was just scared.

798
01:07:28,471 --> 01:07:32,176
The thing is,
I'm not scared anymore.

799
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:33,618
You know what I mean?

800
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:36,419
I'm starting to.

801
01:07:42,012 --> 01:07:45,654
<i>*All those days
Chasing down a daydream*</i>

802
01:07:45,655 --> 01:07:49,944
<i>*All those years
Living in a blur*</i>

803
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:55,019
<i>*All that time
Never truly seeing*</i>

804
01:07:55,020 --> 01:08:01,687
<i>*Things the way they were
Now she's here*</i>

805
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:06,410
<i>*Shining in the starlight
Now she's here*</i>

806
01:08:06,411 --> 01:08:10,894
<i>*Suddenly I know
If she's here*</i>

807
01:08:10,895 --> 01:08:17,767
<i>*It's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go*</i>

808
01:08:17,768 --> 01:08:22,136
<i>*And at last, I see the light*</i>

809
01:08:22,137 --> 01:08:26,059
<i>*And it's like the fog has lifted*</i>

810
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:30,551
<i>*And at last, I see the light*</i>

811
01:08:30,552 --> 01:08:34,719
<i>*And it's like the sky is new*</i>

812
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:45,505
<i>*And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted*</i>

813
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:52,846
<i>*All at once
Everything is different*</i>

814
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:57,355
<i>*Now that I see you.*</i>

815
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:11,555
<i>*Now that I see you.*</i>

816
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:30,193
Is everything okay?

817
01:09:30,194 --> 01:09:33,050
Huh? Oh yes.

818
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:35,217
Uh, yes of course.

819
01:09:35,218 --> 01:09:37,201
I just...

820
01:09:42,693 --> 01:09:44,353
I'm sorry, everything is fine.

821
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:46,917
There's just something I
have to take care of.

822
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,521
Okay.

823
01:09:52,765 --> 01:09:54,755
I'll be right back.

824
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:02,509
It's all right, Pascal.

825
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:11,702
Ahh, there you are.

826
01:10:11,703 --> 01:10:14,816
I've been searching everywhere for
you guys. Since we got separated.

827
01:10:14,817 --> 01:10:17,272
Hey the sideburns are coming
in nice, huh?

828
01:10:17,273 --> 01:10:18,812
You gotta be excited about that.

829
01:10:21,807 --> 01:10:24,052
Anyhow, just wanted to say,

830
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,862
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.

831
01:10:26,863 --> 01:10:31,000
I'll miss you, but I think
its for the... best.

832
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:35,575
Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?

833
01:10:35,827 --> 01:10:38,776
-What?
-We heard you found something.

834
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:41,867
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

835
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:45,598
We want her, instead.

836
01:10:55,181 --> 01:10:59,018
I was starting to think you
ran off with the crown and left me.

837
01:11:05,267 --> 01:11:06,998
He did.

838
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:09,930
What?
No.

839
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:10,937
He wouldn't

840
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,532
See for yourself.

841
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:19,264
Eugene?

842
01:11:21,806 --> 01:11:23,160
Eugene!

843
01:11:25,697 --> 01:11:27,332
Fair trade.

844
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,900
A crown, for the girl
with the magic hair.

845
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:35,776
How much do you think someone
will pay to stay young and healthy forever?

846
01:11:35,777 --> 01:11:37,588
No, please.

847
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:38,888
NO!

848
01:11:39,181 --> 01:11:40,232
NO!

849
01:11:48,442 --> 01:11:49,742
Rapunzel!

850
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,200
Mother?

851
01:11:57,054 --> 01:11:59,717
Oh, my precious girl.

852
01:11:59,718 --> 01:12:01,377
Mother.

853
01:12:01,995 --> 01:12:03,495
Are you all right?

854
01:12:03,496 --> 01:12:04,802
Are you hurt?

855
01:12:04,803 --> 01:12:08,210
-How did you?
-I was so worried about
you dear.

856
01:12:08,211 --> 01:12:09,596
So I followed you.

857
01:12:09,597 --> 01:12:11,428
And I saw them attack you.

858
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,203
Let's go, let's go
before they come to.

859
01:12:43,742 --> 01:12:45,427
You were right, mother.

860
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:48,028
You were right about everything.

861
01:12:48,888 --> 01:12:50,652
I know darling.

862
01:12:52,192 --> 01:12:53,192
I know.

863
01:13:05,824 --> 01:13:06,998
Look!

864
01:13:07,744 --> 01:13:08,944
The crown.

865
01:13:09,456 --> 01:13:10,856
Rapunzel.

866
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:12,877
RAPUNZEL!

867
01:13:15,881 --> 01:13:17,336
Wait, wait, wait.
Guys, guys.

868
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,083
Rapunzel!

869
01:13:41,138 --> 01:13:43,276
Let's get this over with, Ryder.

870
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:46,570
Where are we going?

871
01:13:49,932 --> 01:13:51,583
Oh...

872
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:56,906
There, it never happened.

873
01:13:59,345 --> 01:14:01,425
Now, wash up for dinner.

874
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,080
I'm making hazel nut soup.

875
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:11,454
I really did try, Rapunzel.

876
01:14:11,455 --> 01:14:13,644
I tried to warn you,
what was out there.

877
01:14:14,526 --> 01:14:17,497
The world is dark, and selfish,

878
01:14:17,498 --> 01:14:18,714
and cruel.

879
01:14:18,714 --> 01:14:21,877
If it finds even the slightest
ray of sunshine.

880
01:14:21,878 --> 01:14:24,758
It destroys it.

881
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:06,654
How did you know about her?

882
01:16:06,655 --> 01:16:07,784
Tell me, now!

883
01:16:07,785 --> 01:16:09,013
It wasn't us.

884
01:16:09,013 --> 01:16:10,459
It was the old lady.

885
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,060
Old lady?

886
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:15,491
Wait, no, wait!

887
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:17,292
You don't understand,
she's in trouble.

888
01:16:17,293 --> 01:16:18,235
Wait!

889
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:19,487
Rapunzel?

890
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:23,239
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?

891
01:16:27,103 --> 01:16:28,904
Are you all right?

892
01:16:30,259 --> 01:16:31,792
(Mumbles)
I'm the lost princess.

893
01:16:32,266 --> 01:16:35,825
Please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

894
01:16:35,826 --> 01:16:37,678
I am the lost Princess.

895
01:16:38,398 --> 01:16:39,682
Aren't I?

896
01:16:42,878 --> 01:16:45,262
Did I mumble, Mother?

897
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,154
Or should I even call you that?

898
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:52,591
Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

899
01:16:52,592 --> 01:16:55,145
Why would you ask such
a ridiculous question?

900
01:16:55,146 --> 01:16:58,295
It was you!
It was all, you.

901
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,071
Everything I did, was to protect you.

902
01:17:05,638 --> 01:17:08,748
-Rapunzel.
-I spent my entire life.

903
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,670
Hiding from people who
would use me for my power.

904
01:17:11,671 --> 01:17:14,108
-Rapunzel!
-I should have been hiding.

905
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:15,132
From you.

906
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:16,323
Where will you go?

907
01:17:16,323 --> 01:17:18,275
He won't be there for you.

908
01:17:18,276 --> 01:17:20,070
What did you do to him?

909
01:17:20,071 --> 01:17:23,985
That criminal, is to
be hanged for his crimes.

910
01:17:24,869 --> 01:17:27,629
-No.
-Now, now. It's all right.

911
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:28,672
Listen to me.

912
01:17:28,673 --> 01:17:32,103
All of this is as
it should be.

913
01:17:32,104 --> 01:17:33,191
NO!

914
01:17:33,895 --> 01:17:36,456
You were wrong about the world.

915
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:38,663
And you were wrong about me.

916
01:17:38,665 --> 01:17:43,090
And I will never let you
use my hair, again!

917
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:53,920
You want me to be the bad guy?

918
01:17:53,921 --> 01:17:55,784
Fine.

919
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:58,264
Now I'm the bad, guy.

920
01:18:12,107 --> 01:18:13,416
What's this?

921
01:18:13,804 --> 01:18:15,263
Open up.

922
01:18:16,248 --> 01:18:18,024
What's the password?

923
01:18:18,025 --> 01:18:19,757
-What?
-Nope.

924
01:18:19,758 --> 01:18:21,362
Open this door.

925
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,232
Not even close.

926
01:18:23,233 --> 01:18:24,412
You have three seconds

927
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:25,775
One...

928
01:18:26,971 --> 01:18:27,971
Two...

929
01:18:29,755 --> 01:18:31,028
Three...

930
01:18:33,978 --> 01:18:35,481
(((Clang!)))

931
01:18:35,906 --> 01:18:38,573
Fry pans.
Who knew, right?

932
01:18:54,835 --> 01:18:55,900
(ROARS!)

933
01:18:56,057 --> 01:18:57,365
(Screams like girls)

934
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:08,896
-Head down?
-Head down.

935
01:19:08,897 --> 01:19:09,986
-Thumbs in?
-Thumbs in.

936
01:19:09,987 --> 01:19:11,043
-Knees apart?
-Knees apart.

937
01:19:11,044 --> 01:19:12,010
Knees apart?

938
01:19:12,574 --> 01:19:15,140
Why do I need to keep my...

939
01:19:16,324 --> 01:19:18,324
AHHHHHHHH!

940
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,708
Max.

941
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,676
You brought them here?

942
01:19:27,867 --> 01:19:29,007
Thank you.

943
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:32,982
No really, thank you.

944
01:19:32,982 --> 01:19:38,596
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time
we've just misunderstanding one another.

945
01:19:38,597 --> 01:19:41,712
And we really just, yeah 
your right. We should go.

946
01:19:49,255 --> 01:19:50,335
Max!

947
01:19:54,882 --> 01:19:57,407
WHOAAAAA!

948
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:06,851
Okay Max, lets see how
fast you can run.

949
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,869
Rapunzel.

950
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:30,287
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

951
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,185
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never
see you again.

952
01:20:56,825 --> 01:20:58,852
Now look what you've done,
Rapunzel.

953
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,232
Oh don't worry dear.

954
01:21:01,233 --> 01:21:03,550
Our secret will die with him.

955
01:21:04,969 --> 01:21:07,112
And as for us?

956
01:21:08,465 --> 01:21:12,942
We are going where no one
will ever find you, again.

957
01:21:19,302 --> 01:21:22,742
Rapunzel, really.
Enough all ready.

958
01:21:22,743 --> 01:21:25,198
Stop fighting me.

959
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,566
NO! I won't stop.

960
01:21:27,567 --> 01:21:31,174
For every minute of the rest
of my life I will fight.

961
01:21:31,175 --> 01:21:34,924
I will never stop trying
to get away from you.

962
01:21:37,099 --> 01:21:39,748
But, if you let me save him...

963
01:21:39,749 --> 01:21:41,418
I will go with you.

964
01:21:42,093 --> 01:21:45,317
(Moan) No.
No, Rapunzel.

965
01:21:46,588 --> 01:21:49,165
I'll never run, I'll never
try to escape.

966
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:52,899
Just let me heal him. And
you and I will be together.

967
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,320
Forever, just like you want.

968
01:21:55,321 --> 01:21:56,866
Everything will be
the way it was.

969
01:21:57,896 --> 01:21:59,855
I promise.

970
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:01,940
Just like you want.

971
01:22:04,935 --> 01:22:08,164
Just let me heal him.

972
01:22:13,912 --> 01:22:17,458
In case you get any ideas
about following us.

973
01:22:19,011 --> 01:22:20,345
Eugene!

974
01:22:26,987 --> 01:22:28,120
Oh, I'm so sorry.

975
01:22:28,121 --> 01:22:30,606
-Everything is going to okay, in a moment.
-No, Rapunzel!

976
01:22:30,607 --> 01:22:32,967
-I promise, you have to trust me.
-No..

977
01:22:32,968 --> 01:22:35,685
I can't let you do this.

978
01:22:35,686 --> 01:22:38,249
But I can't let you die.

979
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,913
-But if you do this.
-Shhh.

980
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:43,011
-Then you...will die.
-Hey.

981
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:45,995
It's gonna be all right.

982
01:22:51,169 --> 01:22:54,169
Rapunzel, wait...

983
01:23:03,264 --> 01:23:05,230
Eugene, what...?

984
01:23:05,306 --> 01:23:06,907
NOOO!

985
01:23:11,636 --> 01:23:14,492
No...NO!

986
01:23:14,946 --> 01:23:18,832
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!

987
01:23:25,108 --> 01:23:28,124
No, no, no,
NOOO!

988
01:23:56,061 --> 01:23:58,523
No, no, no, no, Eugene.

989
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,618
Oh, look at me, look I'm right here.

990
01:24:03,619 --> 01:24:05,687
Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.

991
01:24:05,687 --> 01:24:09,001
<i>*Flower gleam and glow,
Let your powers shine*</i>

992
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:12,724
<i>*Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine.*</i>

993
01:24:12,725 --> 01:24:15,068
-Rapunzel...
-What?

994
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:20,520
You were my new dream.

995
01:24:23,354 --> 01:24:25,429
And you were mine.

996
01:24:51,011 --> 01:24:55,099
<i>*Heal what has been hurt.*</i>

997
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:59,583
<i>*Change the fates design.*</i>

998
01:24:59,584 --> 01:25:03,786
<i>*Save what has been lost.*</i>

999
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:09,233
<i>*Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

1000
01:25:11,977 --> 01:25:14,429
What once was mine.

1001
01:26:10,806 --> 01:26:12,896
Rapunzel?

1002
01:26:13,178 --> 01:26:14,378
Eugene.

1003
01:26:16,476 --> 01:26:19,808
Did I ever tell you, I've
got a thing for brunettes?

1004
01:28:00,728 --> 01:28:04,179
<i>(Eugene narrates)
Well, you could imagine what
happened next.</i>

1005
01:28:05,831 --> 01:28:07,674
<i>The kingdom rejoiced.</i>

1006
01:28:07,675 --> 01:28:09,558
<i>The lost Princess had returned.</i>

1007
01:28:09,587 --> 01:28:12,201
<i>The party lasted an entire week.</i>

1008
01:28:12,202 --> 01:28:14,725
<i>And, honestly I don't
remember much of it.</i>

1009
01:28:15,053 --> 01:28:17,232
<i>Dreams came true
all over the place.</i>

1010
01:28:17,233 --> 01:28:20,734
<i>That guy went on to become the
most famous concert pianist in the world.</i>

1011
01:28:23,615 --> 01:28:26,718
<i>And this guy? Well he eventually
found some to love.</i>

1012
01:28:27,711 --> 01:28:30,635
<i>As for this guy, well,
I assume he's happy.</i>

1013
01:28:30,636 --> 01:28:32,222
<i>He can't be proved otherwise.</i>

1014
01:28:34,204 --> 01:28:38,338
<i>Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost over night.</i>

1015
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:42,020
<i>As did most of the apples.</i>

1016
01:28:43,848 --> 01:28:46,780
<i>Pascal, never changed.</i>

1017
01:28:50,796 --> 01:28:52,983
<i>At last Rapunzel was home,</i>

1018
01:28:52,984 --> 01:28:54,778
<i>and she finally had a real family.</i>

1019
01:28:56,245 --> 01:28:58,421
<i>She was a Princess worth
waiting for.</i>

1020
01:28:58,425 --> 01:29:00,670
<i>But above all, she led her kingdom</i>

1021
01:29:00,671 --> 01:29:03,789
<i>with all the grace and wisdom that
her parents did before her.</i>

1022
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,395
<i>And as for me, well.</i>

1023
01:29:06,396 --> 01:29:08,108
<i>I started going by Eugene again.</i>

1024
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:10,570
<i>Stopped thieving, basically
turned it all around.</i>

1025
01:29:10,571 --> 01:29:12,850
<i>But I know what the big question is.</i>

1026
01:29:12,851 --> 01:29:14,682
<i>Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?</i>

1027
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:16,266
<i>Well I'm pleased to tell you.</i>

1028
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:19,110
<i>After years, and years of asking,</i>

1029
01:29:19,111 --> 01:29:22,735
<i>and asking, and asking.</i>

1030
01:29:22,736 --> 01:29:24,710
<i>I finally said yes.</i>

1031
01:29:24,711 --> 01:29:26,261
Rapunzel: *Eugene*

1032
01:29:26,262 --> 01:29:29,373
<i>All right, I asked her.</i>

1033
01:29:29,374 --> 01:29:31,365
Rapunzel:
Will we live happily ever after?

1034
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,272
Yes, we will.
